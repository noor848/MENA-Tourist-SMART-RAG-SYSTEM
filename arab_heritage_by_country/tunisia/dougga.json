      "content": "Dougga or Thugga or TBGG (Arabic: دقة, romanized: Duqqah; Tunisian Arabic: دڨة, romanized: ) was a Berber, Punic and Roman settlement near present-day Téboursouk in northern Tunisia. The current archaeological site covers 75 hectares (190 acres). UNESCO qualified Dougga as a World Heritage Site in 1997, believing that it represents \"the best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa\". The site, which lies in the middle of the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanization, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Dougga's size, its well-preserved monuments and its rich Numidian-Berber, Punic, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history make it exceptional. Amongst the most famous monuments at the site are a Libyco-Punic Mausoleum, the Capitol, the Roman theatre, and the temples of Saturn and of Juno Caelestis.\n\nNames\nThe Numidian name of the settlement was recorded in the Libyco-Berber alphabet as TBGG. The Punic name of the settlement is recorded as tbgg (𐤕𐤁‬𐤂‬𐤂‬) and tbgʿg (𐤕𐤁‬𐤂𐤏‬𐤂). The Root B GG in Phoenician means (\"in the roof terrace\"). Camps states that this may represent a borrowing of a Berber word derived from the root tbg (\"to protect\"). This evidently derives from the site's position atop an easily defensible plateau. The name was borrowed into Latin as Thugga. Once it was granted \"free status\", it was formally refounded and known as Municipium Septimium Aurelium Liberum Thugga; \"Septimium\" and \"Aurelium\" are references to the \"new\" town's \"founders\" (conditores), Septimius Severus and M. Aurelius Antoninus (i.e., Caracalla). For treatment of liberum, see below. Once Dougga received the status of a Roman colony, it was formally known as Colonia Licinia Septimia Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensis.\nIn present-day Berber, it is known as either Dugga or Tugga. That was borrowed into Arabic: دڨة or دقة and Dougga is a French transcription of this Arabic name.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site is located 4.6 km (2.9 mi) SSW of the modern town of Téboursouk on a plateau with an uninhibited view of the surrounding plains in the Oued Khalled. The site offers a high degree of natural protection, which helps to explain its early occupation. The slope on which Dougga is built rises to the north and is bordered in the east by the cliff known as Kef Dougga. Further to the east, the ridge of the Fossa Regia, a ditch and boundary made by the Romans after the destruction of Carthage, indicates Dougga's position as a point of contact between the Punic and Berber worlds.\n\nHistory\nDougga's history is best known from the time of the Roman conquest, even though numerous pre-Roman monuments, including a necropolis, a mausoleum, and several temples have been discovered during archaeological digs. These monuments are an indication of the site's importance before the arrival of the Romans.\n\nBerber Kingdom\nThe city appears to have been founded in the 6th century BC. Some historians believe that Dougga is the city of Tocae (Ancient Greek: Τοκαί, Tokaí), which was captured by a lieutenant of Agathocles of Syracuse at the end of the 4th century BC; Diodorus of Sicily described Tocae as \"a city of beautiful grandeur\".\nDougga was in any case an early and important human settlement. Its urban character is evidenced by the presence of a necropolis with dolmens, the most ancient archaeological find at Dougga, a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic steles, a mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations. Even though our knowledge of the city before the Roman conquest remains very limited, recent archaeological finds have revolutionized the image that we had of this period.\nThe identification of the temple dedicated to Masinissa beneath the forum disproved Louis Poinssot's theory that the Numidian city stood on the plateau but that it was separate from the newer Roman settlement. The temple, which was erected in the tenth year of Micipsa's reign (139 BC), is 14 m × 6.3 m (46 ft × 21 ft) wide. It proves that the area around the forum was already built upon before the arrival of the Roman colonists. A building dating to the 2nd century BC has also been discovered nearby. Similarly, Dougga's mausoleum is not isolated but stands within an urban necropolis.\nRecent finds have disproved earlier theories about the so-called \"Numidian walls\". The walls around Dougga are in fact not Numidian; they are part of the city's fortifications erected in late antiquity. Targeted digs have also proven that what had been interpreted as two Numidian towers in the walls are in fact two funeral monuments from the Numidian era reused much later as foundations and a section of defences.\nThe discovery of Libyan and Punic inscriptions at the site provoked a debate on the administration of the city at the time of the Kingdom of Numidia. The debate—about the interpretation of epigraphic sources—focussed on the question of whether the city was still under Punic influence or whether it was increasingly Berber. Local Berber institutions distinct from any form of Punic authority arose from the Numidian period onwards, but Camps notes that Punic shofets were still in place in several cities, including Dougga, during the Roman era, which is a sign of continuing Punic influence and the preservation of certain elements of Punic civilization well after the fall of Carthage.\n\nRoman Empire\nThe Romans granted Dougga the status of an indigenous city (Latin: civitas) following their conquest of the region.\nThe creation of the colony of Carthage during the reign of Augustus complicated Dougga's institutional status. The city was included in the territory (pertica) of the Roman colony, but around this time, a community (pagus) of Roman colonists also arose alongside the existing settlement. For two centuries, the site was thus governed by two civic and institutional bodies: the city with its peregrini and the pagus with its Roman citizens. Both had Roman civic institutions: magistrates and a council (ordo) of decurions for the city, a local council from the end of the 1st century AD, and local administrators for the pagus, who were legally subordinated to the distant but powerful colony of Carthage. In addition, epigraphic evidence indicates that a Punic-style dual magistracy, the sufetes, achieved some civic stature here well into the imperial period. In fact, the city once had three magistrates serve at once, a relative rarity in the Mediterranean.\nOver time, the romanization of the city brought the two communities closer together. Notable members of the peregrini increasingly adopted Roman culture and behavior, became Roman citizens, and the councils of the two communities began to take decisions in unison. The increasing closeness of the communities was facilitated at first by their geographic proximity—there was no physical distinction between their two settlements—and then later by institutional arrangements. During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the city was granted Roman law; from this moment onward, the magistrates automatically received Roman citizenship and the rights of the city's inhabitants became similar to those of the Roman citizens. During the same era, the pagus won a certain degree of autonomy from Carthage; it was able to receive bequests and administer public funds.\nNonetheless, it was not until AD 205, during the reign of Septimius Severus, that the two communities came together as one municipality (municipium), made \"free\" (see below) while Carthage's pertica was reduced. The city was supported by the euergetism of its great families of wealthy individuals, which sometimes reached exorbitant levels, while its interests were successfully represented by appeals to the emperors. Dougga's development culminated during the reign of Gallienus, when it obtained the status of a separate Roman colony.\nDougga's monuments attest to its prosperity in the period from the reign of Diocletian to that of Theodosius I, but it fell into a sort of stupor from the 4th century. The city appears to have experienced an early decline, as evidenced by the relatively poor remains of Christianity. The period of Byzantine rule saw the area around the forum transformed into a fort; several important buildings were destroyed in order to provide the necessary materials for its construction.\n\nCaliphate\nDougga was never completely abandoned following the Muslim invasions of the area. For a long time, Dougga remained the site of a small village populated by the descendants of the city's former inhabitants, as evidenced by the small mosque situated in the Temple of August Piety and the small bath dating to the Aghlabid period on the southern flank of the forum.\n\nArchaeological work\nThe first Western visitors to have left eyewitness accounts of the ruins reached the site in the 17th century. This trend continued in the 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. The best-preserved monuments, including the mausoleum, were described and, at the end of this period, were the object of architectural studies.\nThe establishment of France's Tunisian protectorate in 1881 led to the creation of a national antiquities institute (French: Institut national du patrimoine), for which the excavation of the site at Dougga was a priority from 1901, parallel to the works carried out at Carthage. The works at Dougga concentrated at first on the area around the forum; other discoveries ensured that there was an almost constant series of digs at the site until 1939. Alongside these excavations, work was conducted to restore the capitol, of which only the front and the base of the wall of the cella were still standing, and to restore the mausoleum, particularly between 1908 and 1910 .\nAfter Tunisia's independence, other buildings were excavated, including the Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany. During the same period, the last inhabitants of the site were evicted and relocated to a village located on the plain several kilometers from the antique site, which is named New Dougga. In 1991, the decision was taken to make the site into a national archaeological park. A cooperative scientific programme aims in particular to promote the study of the inscriptions at the site and the pagan temples. In 1997, Dougga was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\nDespite its importance and its exceptional state, Dougga remains off the beaten track for many tourists and receives only about 50,000 visitors per year. In order to make it more attractive, the construction of an on-site museum is being considered, while the national antiquities institute has established a website presenting the site and the surrounding region. For the time being, visitors with sufficient time can appreciate Dougga, not only because of its many ruins but also for its olive groves, which give the site a unique ambiance.\n\nDougga's \"Liberty\"\nFrom AD 205, when the city (civitas) and community (pagus) fused into one municipality (municipium), Dougga bore the title liberum, whose significance is not immediately clear. The term appears in the titles of a certain number of other municipia also founded at the same time: Thibursicum Bure, Aulodes, and Thysdrus. Several interpretations of its meaning have been suggested. According to Merlin and Poinssot, the term derives from the name of the god Liber, in whose honor a temple was erected at Dougga. The epithet Liberum would thus follow the same pattern as Frugifer and Concordia, which appear in the title of Thibursicum Bure. Thibursicum Bure is however an exception to the rule; the titles of the other municipia including the term liberum do not include the names of any divinities, and this hypothesis has therefore been abandoned. Alternatively, liberum is taken as a reference to free status (libertas, \"liberty\"). This interpretation is confirmed by an inscription found at Dougga that honors Alexander Severus as the \"preserver of liberty\" (conservator libertatis).\nIt is, however, unclear exactly what form this liberty took. Toutain is of the opinion that this is a designation for a particular type of municipium—free cities where the Roman governor did not have the right to control the municipal magistrates. There is however no evidence that Dougga enjoyed exceptional legal privileges of the type associated with certain free cities such as Aphrodisias in Asia Minor. Veyne has thus suggested that Dougga's \"freedom\" is nothing but an expression of the concept of liberty without any legal meaning; obtaining the status of a municipium had freed the city of its subjugation and enabled it to adorn itself with the \"ornaments of liberty\" (ornamenta libertatis). The city's liberty was celebrated just as its dignity was extolled; the emperor Probus is a \"preserver of liberty and dignity\" (conservator libertatis et dignitatis). Gascou, in line with Veyne's interpretation, describes the situation thus: \"Liberum, in Thugga's title, is a term [...] with which the city, which had waited a long time for the status of a municipium, is happy to flatter itself\".\n\nDespite Gascou's conclusion, efforts have been made more recently to identify concrete aspects of Dougga's liberty. Lepelley believes on the one hand that this must be a reference to the relations between the city and Rome and on the other hand that the term can cover a range of diverse privileges of differing degrees. It is known that the territory of Carthage, to which the Dougga pagus belonged until AD 205, enjoyed such privileges: the inhabitants of the pagus even sent an appeal during Trajan's reign to defend the fiscal immunity of the territory of Carthage (immunitas perticae Carthaginiensium). The Dougga civitas had not been granted this concession, so the fusion of pagus with the civitas meant that the citizens of the pagus risked losing their enviable privilege. The liberty of the municipia founded during the reign of Septimius Severus could thus be a reference to the fiscal immunity made possible by the region's great wealth and by the emperor's generosity to each municipium at the time of its fusion. During the reign of Gallienus, a certain Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus, a well-known individual in Dougga, made an appeal to the emperor \"in order to assure the public liberty\". Lepelley believes that this is an indication that the city's privilege had been called into question, although Dougga appears to have been at least partially able to preserve its concessions, as evidenced by an inscription to the honor of \"Probus, defender of its liberty\".\nAccording to Christol though, this interpretation overly restricts the meaning of the word libertas. In Christol's view, it is important not to forget that the emperor's decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the specter of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed \"concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbors\". This would explain the honor that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, \"protector of the community\").\nFor Christol, the term liberum must be understood in this context and in an abstract sense. This liberty derives from belonging to a city and expresses the end of the civitas's dependence, \"the elevation of a community of peregrini to the liberty of Roman citizenship\", which also served to placate the fears of the inhabitants of the pagus and to open the door to a later promotion, to the status of a colony. This promotion took place in AD 261, during the reign of Gallienus, following an appeal from Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus in Christol's version of events. Thereafter, the defence of the libertas publica was not a question of defending a privilege at risk, but of requesting the \"ultimate liberty\" (summa libertas)—the promotion to the status of a colony. Christol also points out that, despite the abstract character of terms such as libertas or dignitas, their formal appearance should be references to concrete and unique events.\n\nGeneral layout\nThe city as it exists today consists essentially of remains from the Roman era dating for the most part to the 2nd and 3rd century. The Roman builders had to take account both of the site's particularly craggy terrain and of earlier constructions, which led them to abandon the normal layout of Roman settlements, as is also particularly evident in places such as Timgad.\nRecent archaeological digs have confirmed the continuity in the city's urban development. The heart of the city has always been at the top of the hill, where the forum replaced the Numidian agora. As Dougga developed, urban construction occupied the side of the hill, so that the city must have resembled \"a compact mass\", according to Hédi Slim\nEarly archaeological digs concentrated on public buildings, which meant that private buildings tended at first to be uncovered at the ends of the trenches dug for this purpose. Later, trenches were cut with the purpose of exposing particularly characteristic private buildings.\n\nNumidian residence\nTraces of a residence dating to the Numidian era have been identified in the foundations of the temple dedicated to Liber. Although these traces are very faint, they served to disprove the theories of the first archaeologists, including Louis Poinssot, that the Roman and pre-Roman settlements were located on separate sites. The two settlements evidently overlapped.\n\nThe trifolium villa\nThis residence, which dates to the 2nd or 3rd century, stands downhill from the quarters that surround the forum and the principal public monuments in the city, in an area where the streets are winding.\nThe trifolium villa, named after a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house excavated so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands in the south of the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because of the way in which it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.\n\nThe market\nThe market dates from the middle of the 1st century. It took the form of a square 35.5 m × 28 m (116 ft × 92 ft) in size, surrounded by a portico and shops on two sides. The northern side had a portico, while an exedra occupied the southern side. The exedra probably housed a statue of Mercury.\nIn order to compensate for the natural incline of the ground on which the market stands, its builders undertook significant earthworks. These earthworks have been dated as being amongst the oldest Roman constructions, and their orientation vis-à-vis the forum seems to suggest that they were not built on any earlier foundations. The modern-day location of the remains from the market near the forum should however not be misunderstood as indicating a link between the two. The market was almost completely destroyed during the construction of the Byzantine fort. It was excavated in 1918–1919.\n\nLicinian Baths\nThe Licinian Baths are interesting for having much of its original walls intact, as well as a long tunnel used by the slaves working at the baths. The baths were donated to the city by the Licinii family in the 3rd century. They were primarily used as winter baths. The frigidarium  has triple arcades at both ends and large windows with views over the valley beyond.\n\nFunerary structures\nDolmens\nThe presence of dolmens in North Africa has served to stoke historiographic debates that have been said to have ideological agendas. The dolmens at Dougga have been the subject of archaeological digs, which have also uncovered skeletons and ceramic models.\nAlthough it is difficult to put a date on the erection of the dolmens, as they were in use until the dawn of the Christian era, it seems likely that they date from at least 2000 years BC. Gabriel Camps has suggested that a link to Sicily. He has made the same suggestion for the \"haouanet\" tombs found in Algeria and Tunisia.\n\nNumidian bazina tombs\nA type of tomb unique to the Numidian world has been discovered at Dougga. They are referred to as bazina tombs or circular monument tombs.\n\nPunic-Libyan Mausoleum\nThe Mausoleum of Ateban is one of the very rare examples of royal Numidian architecture. There is another in Sabratha in Libya. Some authors believe that there is a link with the funeral architecture in Anatolia and the necropoleis in Alexandria from the 3rd and 2nd century BC.\nThis tomb is 21 m (69 ft) tall and was built in the 2nd century BC. A bilingual inscription installed in the mausoleum mentioned that the tomb was dedicated to Ateban, the son of Iepmatath and Palu. In 1842, Sir Thomas Reade, the British consul in Tunis seriously damaged the monument while removing this inscription. This bilingual Punic-Libyan Inscription, now held at the British Museum, made it possible to decode the Libyan characters. It has only recently been established that the inscription was originally located on one side of a fake window on the podium. According to the most recent research, the names cited in the inscription are only those of its architect and of representatives of the different professions involved in its construction. The monument was built by the inhabitants of the city for a Numidian prince; some authors believe that it was intended for Massinissa\nThe monument owes its current appearance to the work of French archaeologist Louis Poinssot, who essentially reconstructed it from pieces that were left lying on the ground. The tomb is accessed via a pedestal with five steps. On the northern side of the podium (the lowest of three levels in the monument), there is an opening to the funeral chamber that is closed with a stone slab. The other sides are decorated with fake windows and four Aeolic pilasters. The second level is made up of a temple-like colonnade (naiskos); the columns on each side are Ionic. The third level is the most richly decorated of all: in addition to pilasters similar to those on the lowest level, it is capped with a pyramid. Some elements of carved stone have also survived.\n\nRoman sepulchres\nAlthough work has in the past been undertaken to uncover the Roman sepulchres, today they have been reclaimed in part by olive trees.\n\nThe different necropoleis mark the zones of settlement at Dougga. There are five areas that have been identified as necropoleis: the first in the northeast, around the Temple of Saturn and the Victoria Church, the second in the northwest, a zone which also encompasses the dolmens on the site, the third in the west, between the Aïn Mizeb and Aïn El Hammam cisterns and to the north of the Temple of Juno Caelestis, the fourth and the fifth in the south and the south-east, one around the mausoleum and the other around Septimius Severus' triumphal arch.\n\nHypogeum\nThe hypogeum is a half-buried edifice from the 3rd century. It was erected in the middle of the oldest necropolis, which was excavated in 1913. The hypogeum was designed to house funeral urns in small niches in the walls; at the time of its discovery, it contained sarcophagi, which suggests that it was in use for a long time.\n\nPolitical monuments\nTriumphal arches\nDougga still contains two triumphal arches, which are in different states of disrepair.\n\nSeptimius Severus's arch, which is heavily damaged, stands close to the mausoleum and on the route leading from Carthage to Théveste. It was erected in AD 205.\nAlexander Severus' arch, which dates from 222 to 235, is relatively well preserved, despite the loss of its upper elements. It is equidistant from the capitol and the Temple of Juno Caelestis. Its arcade is 4 m (13 ft) tall.\nA third triumphal arch, dating from the Tetrarchy, has been completely lost.\n\nForum\nThe city forum, which is 924 m2 (9,950 sq ft) in size is small. It is better preserved in some places than others, because the construction of the Byzantine fort damaged a large section of it. The capitol, which stands on an area surrounded by porticos, dominates its surroundings by virtue of its imposing appearance. The \"square of the Rose of the Winds\" (which is named after a decorative element) seems more like an esplanade leading to the Temple of Mercury, which stands on its northern side, than an open public space. The city's curia and a tribune for speeches probably also stood here.\nLong ago, archaeologists believed that Roman settlement at Dougga occurred ex nihilo. This suggestion has been contradicted by the discovery of a sanctuary dedicated to Massinissa amongst the substructures to the rear of the capitol.\n\nRecreational facilities\nTheatre\nRoman theatres were a fundamental element of the monumental make-up of a city from the reign of Augustus.\nThe theatre, which was built in AD 168 or 169, is one of the best preserved examples in Roman Africa. It could seat 3500 spectators, even though Dougga only had 5000 inhabitants. It was one of a series of imperial buildings constructed over the course of two centuries at Dougga which deviate from the classic \"blueprints\" only inasmuch as they have been adapted to take account of the local terrain. Some minor adjustments have been made and the local architects had a certain freedom with regard to the ornamentation of the buildings.\n\nA dedication engraved into the pediment of the stage and on the portico the dominates the city, recalls the building's commissioner, P. Marcius Quadratus, who \"built [it] for his homeland with his own denarii\"; the dedication was celebrated with \"scenic representations, distributions of life, a festival and athletic games\".\nThe theater is still used for performances of classic theater, particularly during the festival of Dougga, and conservation work has been carried out on it.\n\nAuditorium\nThe site known as the auditorium is an annex of the Temple of Liber, which probably served for the initiation of novices. Despite its modern appellation, the auditorium was not a site for spectacles; only its form suggests otherwise. It measures 20 m × 20 m (66 ft × 66 ft).\n\nCircus\nThe city has a circus designed for chariot racing, but it is barely visible nowadays. Originally, the circus consisted of nothing more than a field; an inscription in the temple in honor of Caracalla's victory in Germany notes that the land was donated by the Gabinii in 214 and describes it as an ager qui appellatur circus (field that serves as a circus) ). In 225 though, the site was prepared and the circus was constructed. It was financed by the magistrates (duumviri and aedile) after they had promised to do so following in response to a request from the entire population of the city. The circus was built to take the maximum possible advantage of the surrounding landscape, in reflection of an understandable need to limit costs in a medium-sized city with limited resources, but certainly also out of desire to finish the construction works as quickly as possible, given that magistrates' mandates were limited to one year. The construction was nonetheless expected to have \"a certain magnitude\"; at 393 m (1,289 ft) long with a spina 190 m × 6 m (623 ft × 20 ft), the circus is quite extraordinary in Roman Africa. The circus marks Dougga out as one of the most important cities in the province, alongside Carthage, Thysdrus, Leptis Magna, Hadrumet et Utica. The donation of the land for the pleasure of the general populace (ad voluptatem populi) and its development following a request from the entire population (postulante universo populo) are a reminder of the importance of spectacles in the social life of Roman cities and the demand for popular entertainment.\n\nAmphitheater\nThe question of whether there was an amphitheater at Dougga has not been conclusively answered. Traditionally, a large elliptic depression to the northwest of the site has been interpreted as the site of an amphitheater. Archeologists have however become much more cautious on this subject.\n\nBaths\nThree Roman baths have been completely excavated at Dougga; a fourth has so far only been partially uncovered. Of these four baths, one (\"the bath of the house to the west of the Temple of Tellus\") belongs to a private residence, two, the Aïn Doura bath and the bath known for a long time as the \"Licinian bath\", were, judging by their size, open to the public, while the nature of the last bath, the bath of the Cyclopses, is more difficult to interpret.\n\nBath of the Cyclopses\nDuring the excavation of the Bath of the Cyclopses, a mosaic of cyclopses forging Jupiter's thunderbolts was uncovered. It is now on display at the Bardo National Museum, where several very well preserved latrines are also on display. The building has been dated to the 3rd century CE on the basis of a study of the mosaic.\nThe size of the building (its frigidarium is less than 30 m2 (320 sq ft)) has led some experts to believe that it was a private bath, but the identification of a domus in the immediate vicinity has proven difficult. The \"trifolium villa\" is quite distant, and the closest ruins are hard to identify as they have not been well preserved. Yvon Thébert therefore suggests that the bath served the local quarter.\n\nAntonian or Licinian Bath\nThe Antonian Bath, which dates from the 3rd century, was known as the Licinian Baths (after emperor Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus) and has several storeys. Louis Poinssot's identification of the bath as dating to Gallienus' reign on the basis of incomplete inscriptions and Dougga's prosperity at this time has been called into question by recent research, conducted in particular by Michel Christol. Christol has suggested that the bath dates from the reign of Caracalla; this thesis has since been confirmed by an analysis of inscriptions. Others have even suggested that the bath dates from the reign of the Severan dynasty, because of a particularity which became common a century later in the west: the columns in the northwest peristyle feature daises bearing arches.\nThe bath was later used for the production of olive oil at an unknown date.\nThe symmetrical building is medium-sized, with an area of 1,700 m2 (18,000 sq ft) excluding the palaestra, of which 175 m2 (1,880 sq ft) are taken up by the frigidarium. The construction of the bath required work both to lower and to raise sections of the slope on which it stood, which may explain why parts of the building have been better preserved than others; the section built on raised ground has for the most part been lost.\n\nAïn Doura Baths\nIn the immediate vicinity of Aïn Doura is a partially excavated complex that could turn out to be the largest bath in the city, the Aïn Doura Baths. On the basis of the mosaics that have been found here, it has been suggested that the bath dates from the end of the 2nd century or the start of the 3rd century, and that the mosaic décor was renewed in the 4th century CE.\nThe complex remains largely unexposed, but it seems, according to Yvon Thébert, that it has a symmetrical design, of which only a section of the cold rooms has been excavated.\n\nThe bath of the house to the west of the Temple of Tellus\nThis bath, measuring 75 m2 (810 sq ft), which can be accessed from the house and from the street, was uncovered at the start of the 20th century. The archaeological analysis of the bath's relationship with the house in which it is located has led Thébert to suggest that it was a later addition to the original construction but he does not propose a date for this event.\n\nReligious edifices\nThere is archaeological or epigraphic evidence for more than twenty temples at Dougga; a significant number for a small city. There are archaeological remains and inscriptions proving the existence of eleven temples, archaeological remains of a further eight, and inscriptions referring to another fourteen. This abundance of religious sites is the result in particular of the philanthropy of wealthy families.\n\nTemple of Massinissa\nThe Temple of Massinissa is located on the western flank of the capital. The first archaeologists believed that the remains of the temple were a monumental fountain, even though an inscription proving the existence of a sanctuary to the deceased Numidian king was discovered in 1904. This inscription has been dated to 139 BC, during the reign of Micipsa.\nThe remains are similar to those of the temple in Chemtou and are evidence of the fact that the political center of the Roman city was in the same place as the Hellenic agora. The stone remains found in this area seem to belong to several different structures; the exact location of the sanctuary is still open to debate.\nAlthough it is believed that the sanctuary set Massinissa on par with a god, this is debated by some experts. Gsell believes that a temple to the king would reflect a continuation of eastern and Hellenic practices; Camps builds on this hypothesis, pointing out the lack of any antique sources testifying to anything more than simple expressions of respect by a people vis-à-vis its king. According to Camps, the temple is only a memorial, a site belonging to a funeral cult. Its construction ten years into Micipsa's reign can be explained by its political symbolism: Micipsa, sole ruler after the death of his brothers Gulussa and Mastanabal, was affirming the unity of his kingdom around the person of the king.\n\nThe Capitol\nThe Capitol is a Roman temple from the 2nd century, principally dedicated to Rome's protective triad: Jupiter Best and Greatest (Jupiter Optimus Maximus), Juno the Queen (Juno Regina), and Minerva the August (Minerva Augusta). It has a secondary dedication to the wellbeing of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius; judging by this reference, the Capitol must have been completed in AD 166-167.\nThomas d'Arcos identified the Capitol as a temple of Jupiter in the 17th century. It was the object of further research at the end of the 19th century, led in particular by the doctor Louis Carton in 1893. The walls, executed in opus africanum style, and the entablature of the portico were restored between 1903 and 1910. Claude Poinssot discovered a crypt beneath the cella in 1955. The most recent works were carried out by the Tunisian Institut national du patrimoine between 1994 and 1996.\nThe Capitol is exceptionally well preserved, which is a consequence of its inclusion in the Byzantine fortification. A series of eleven stairs lead up to the front portico. The temple front's Corinthian columns are 8 m (26 ft) tall, on top of which is the perfectly preserved pediment. The pediment bears a depiction of emperor Antoninus Pius's elevation to godhood. The emperor is being carried by an eagle.\nThe base of the cella still features alcoves for three statues. The middle alcove houses a colossal statue of Jupiter.\nThe discovery of the head of a statue of Jupiter has led Poinssot to suggest that the crypt dates from the period of Christianity's triumph over the old religions. St-Amans does not exclude the possibility that the crypt was built at the same time as the Byzantine citadel, of which the forum and capitol formed the nerve center.\nThe construction of the Capitol at Dougga occurred at the same time as the construction of other monuments of the same type elsewhere in North Africa, which Gros explains as a consequence of the greater proximity of the imperial cult and the cult of Jupiter.\nNear the Capitol are the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\"—which is named after a compass rose that is engraved on the floor—and the remains of the Byzantine citadel, which reused a section of the ruins after the city's decline.\n\nTemple of Mercury\nThe Temple of Mercury is also dedicated to Tellus. It faces towards the market; between the two lies the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\". The temple is largely in ruins. It has three cellae but no courtyard. The sanctuary, which can be accessed via a series of four stairs, stands on a faded podium. It was excavated and shored up between 1904 and 1908.\n\nTemple of August Piety\nThe small Temple of August Piety was built during the reign of Hadrian. It was financed through the philanthropy of a certain Caius Pompeius Nahanius. The temple faces the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\". Part of the vestibule survives. Behind the temple, on the foundations of the Temple of Fortuna, Venus Concordia and Mercury, stands a mosque. The mosque is the last remnant of the little village that existed on the site until the creation of New Dougga.\nD'Arcos identified the temple in 1631 thanks to an inscription that was still in place at the time. The podium is relatively low (1–1.5 m or 3 ft 3 in – 4 ft 11 in); it can be ascended by a series of seven stairs on the southern side.\n\nTemple of Minerva\nThe first Temple of Minerva at Dougga was a gift of the patron of the civitas at the end of the 1st century, but the more important site dedicated to this divinity is a building which features a temple and an area surrounded by a portico dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius. It was financed through the philanthropy of a priestess of the imperial cult, Julia Paula Laenatiana. The building was designed to take advantage of the slope on which it stands; the podium is at the level of the roof of the portico and the temple in the strict sense of the word is located outside the surrounding building. The stairs providing access to the temple accentuates the inaccessible nature of the divinity.\n\nTemple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany\nThe Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany is the only edifice dedicated to the imperial cult to have been located precisely at Dougga. Fragments of an inscription on the temple's lintel were discovered in 1835, but the temple was not identified until 1966. It features a nymphaeum that dates to the reign of Commodus.\nThe temple, which is relatively narrow, has an unusual design. It is 41.5 m × 14.2 m (136 ft × 47 ft), and is situated beside the road that descends from the forum to the Aïn Doura Bath. The temple is associated with a triumphal arch over the road. The temple can be accessed via a semi-circular staircase; in each corner of the courtyard in front of the staircase is a reservoir for rain water. The cella inside the sanctuary features six lateral niches which are designed to hold the bases of statues of Apollo, Liber, Neptune, Mercury and of two other gods that can no longer be identified.\nThe temple can be seen from afar, but passers-by can only see the cella, the foundations of which are decoratively rusticated. Seven columns are spaced along the cella, linking to the lateral door, which opens onto the staircase. The tetrastyle temple is built in Tuscan order in antis. The temple's design is unusual inasmuch as temples of the imperial cult are generally Corinthian and located in the middle of a vast courtyard with a portico; the Tuscan order was thus quite rare in the provinces.\nThe temple therefore bears witness to a desire to construct something that was different from other such buildings, doubtless in response to the constraints created by the terrain. The dedication in the temple sheds light on its construction: the inscription, which has been very precisely dated to AD 214, consecrates the temple to the personification of victory, Victoria, here specifically in connection with the emperor's campaigns in Germany, for the welfare of Caracalla and of his mother Iulia Domna.\nThe text recalls the military projects of the son of Septimius Severus and their celebration within the context of the imperial cult. This inscription also explains that the temple was constructed at a cost of 100,000 sestertii on the wishes of a great lady of Dougga named Gabinia Hermiona after her death. Besides the generosity of this act of philanthropy, her will foresaw the holding of an annual banquet for the ordo decurionum to be financed by her inheritors on the anniversary of the dedication of the temple. At the same time, Gabinia Hermiona bequeathed the land for the circus \"for the pleasure of the people\".\nThe temple occupied what was doubtlessly one of the last free spaces in the vicinity of the forum. The temple's benefactor preferred this site in the city center to those that she owned in the outskirts: the site of the circus or the site where the Temple of Celeste was later built. Gabinia's family, one of the richest in Dougga, was well placed within Carthage's notables and maintained its power at Dougga, even during the reduction of the local aristocracy in the 3rd century. The terms of Gabinia's will provide evidence of her concern that the family should endure - the annual banquet would keep alive the memory of the family's generosity and emphasize its sociability, while the circus would provide for the pleasure of the most humble of the city's inhabitants.\n\nAt the end of the 4th century, the Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany was transformed into a church. The reservoirs in the courtyard were filled in order to provide space for the faithful, while pulpits were added to the cella. The decoration of the cella was also modified.\n\nTemple of Pluto\nPluto receives particular honor at Dougga as the city's patron divinity, as demonstrated by the Genius Thuggae.\nIt is possible that the Temple of Pluto is located near Septimius Severus's triumphal arch in an area of the city that has only been partially excavated as yet, but this hypothesis is not very firm and is based on the discovery of a bust in a courtyard, which has been dated by Poinssot to the 2nd or 3rd century. The associated building was excavated in the 1960s but little is known about the manner in which the excavation was conducted and the stabilization work carried out at the site. A cella with just one niche has been discovered on a podium in the middle of a courtyard and the altar has also been preserved.\nAn architectural study was carried out between 2000 and 2002, but it did not lead to any excavation work.\n\nTemple of Saturn\nSaturn was the successor of the Punic Ba'al Hammon and was the attendant (paredros) of Tanit or Heavenly Juno (Juno Caelestis). During the Roman era, the city of Dougga had at least two sanctuaries dedicated to Saturn. The evidence for the existence of one of the two derives mostly from inscriptions found in the city. The second temple, which is the one commonly known as the Temple of Saturn at Dougga, has been excavated. The remains of this temple, which are less significant than those of the capitol or the Temple of Juno Caelestis, are of particular interest because of their location. The ruins lie atop a promontory that overlooks the rich cereal valley of the Oued Khalled, 160 m (520 ft) from the theater and outside the bounds of the city. During the excavation works, remains of a temple of Ba'al Hammon, particularly ritual ditches (favissae) containing ex-votos, were discovered. The Roman temple thus replaced an indigenous sanctuary that dated back at least to the 2nd century BC. This sanctuary consisted essentially of a wide open space designed to receive ex-votos and sacrifices. It was covered over to facilitate the construction of the Temple of Saturn, the ruins of which can still be seen today.\nThe Roman temple was built during the reign of Septimius Severus. It consists of three cellae, a courtyard with a portico, and a vestibule. Water from the temple roof was collected in cisterns. An inscription provides details about the temple's construction: it was erected using funds bequeathed in the testament of a notable local resident named Lucius Octavius Victor Roscianus at a cost of at least 150,000 sestertii, which seems expensive but may be explained by the extent of the earthworks required to give the temple a solid foundation; these works nonetheless seem to have proven insufficient as work to restore and shore up the edifice appear to have been carried out before it finally fell into ruin.\n\nTemple of Juno Caelestis\nThe Temple of Juno Caelestis, which was built on the outskirts of the city, was described in the 17th century and excavated in the 1890s. Significant restoration work was undertaken between 1904 and 1914, and new studies were carried out between 1999 and 2002.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Heavenly Juno (Juno Caelestis), the successor of the Punic god Tanit. Its well-preserved temenos is demarcated by a wall, a large section of which has been very well preserved. The court is only partially tiled and has two symmetrical doors. A portico with 25 bays runs along the circular section of the temenos. The portico is topped with a frieze depicting the construction of the temple.\nThe temple in the strict sense of the word stands on a high podium that can be accessed via a series of eleven steps. It is a Corinthian hexastyle peripteros. The pediment features a dedication to Alexander Severus. The cella has been completely lost.\nThe temple, which was erected between AD 222 and 235, was paid for by a certain Q. Gabinius Rufus Felix, who donated inter alia two silver statues of Juno Caelestis that cost 35,000 sestertii.\nThe temenos, which is 52 m (171 ft) in diameter, is reminiscent of a crescent moon, the symbol of Juno Caelestis.\n\nDar Lacheb\nThe purpose of the edifice known as Dar Lacheb (Latin: Domus Lachebia, \"House of Lacheb\") has not been clearly identified. St-Amans believes that it is a sanctuary dedicated to Aesculapius, which accords with Poinssot's hypothesis that it is a temple.\nDar Lacheb was excavated at the end of the 19th century by Carton and has not been the subject of further works since 1912. A house that was built nearby re-using antique remains was destroyed at the start of the 20th century.\nDar Lacheb was built between AD 164 and 166, at the same era as the capitol, which is 50 m (160 ft) away. The entrance to the building has been perfectly preserved, as has one of the columns of the entrance porch. The interior consists of a courtyard that was once surrounded with a portico. To the south is the cella of a temple that has been entirely destroyed.\n\nVictoria Church\nThe Victoria Church, which stands in the northeast of the site, below the Temple of Saturn, is the only Christian building that has been so far excavated at Dougga. At the end of the 4th century or at the start of the 5th century, the Christian community erected the unusually designed little church over a pagan cemetery. The small hypogeum is located nearby.\n\nBishopric\nDuring antiquity, Thugga was also the seat of the bishop of Thucca Terenbenthina. The bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the Arian Vandal Kingdom and Orthodox Byzantine Empire, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The diocese was re-founded by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see in the 20th century.\n\nInfrastructure\nCisterns and aqueducts\nDougga has two networks of cisterns, in the north and in the west, one of which is particularly well preserved. An aqueduct leading to the city, located a short distance from the well-preserved cisterns, is amongst the best preserved examples of this type of structure on the territory of modern-day Tunisia.\nThe six cisterns of Aïn El Hammam, situated close to the Temple of Juno Caelestis, have a total capacity of 6000 m3 but are in ruins. They were fed by a spring 12 km (7.5 mi) away and an aqueduct constructed during the reign of Commodus and restored in the last quarter of the 4th century CE.\nThis site is still used once annually for a festival celebrating Mokhola, who was a female saint and benefactor of Moroccan origin according to local oral tradition The veneration of Mokhola is accompanied with animal sacrifices. It has been shown that this tradition has pagan origins; the object of veneration was originally the spring, known as fons moccolitanus\nThe second network of cisterns, the cisterns of Aïn Mizeb, is very well preserved. Located close to the Temple of Minerva, these eight domed reservoirs can hold 9,000 m3 (320,000 cu ft) and feature a basin into which they decant. The cisterns are fed by a spring located 200 m (660 ft) away connected via an underground aqueduct.\nA final network of secondary cisterns is located in the vicinity of the Aïn Doura Bath, in the south-west of the site.\n\nStreets\nDougga's streets are not laid out as prescribed by the normal theoretical model of a Roman settlement—around a cardo and a decumanus—as a result of the city's unique design.\nThe center of the city was probably paved; the streets resembled meandering lanes. The city had sewers, as is evidenced by the access stones that are still in place in the streets. At the foot of the hill, there are traces of streets joining with the main road from Carthage to Theveste\n\nDiscoveries made at Dougga\nThe site at Dougga has offered up numerous works or art, many of which have been removed and placed in museums, most notably the Bardo National Museum in Tunis.\n\nWorks on site\nFew works of art have been left on site, with the exception of a sculpture of a togate man (togatus) at the \"Square of the Rose of the Winds\" and a number of mosaics, including those in the building known as the house of Venus and in particular at the Aïn Doura Bath. This is a consequence of the discovery of Dougga's works of art at a time when archaeological sites were robbed of their treasures and abandoned after a dig. This approach has made it possible to preserve a certain number of mosaics with their colours intact; other mosaics that were uncovered but not removed have suffered due to their exposure to the elements.\nA proposal to construct a museum on the site is being studied. It would serve in particular to house recent discoveries and those yet to be made.\n\nWorks at the Bardo National Museum\nStatues\nA number of heads of emperors have been discovered during the digs at the site. Amongst these, the portrait of Lucius Verus is particularly noteworthy: he is depicted with a generous head of hair, a full beard and a vivacity that makes it one of the most significant statues yet discovered in Roman Africa. This African masterpiece was realized in marble from Carrara and still has traces of color amongst the hairs.\nThe Bardo National Museum also houses a togate man (togatus) that dates from the 3rd century. It depicts an aged man, who has a short beard and is dressed in a toga. It seems certain that this is a later work of art reflective of the contemporary taste in art.\n\nMosaics\nThe \"butler's mosaic\" dating from the middle of the 3rd century features a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras on their shoulders. The two amphoras bear the letters ΡΙΕ (Rie, \"Drink!\" in Ancient Greek) and ΖΗϹΗϹ (Zēsēs, \"You will live!\"). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests and a promise of hospitality. The same is true of another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (\"May everything please you\").\nThe \"mosaic of the victorious charioteer\" is younger than these works. It dates from the second half of the 4th century, and features the phrase Eros omnia per te (\"All things through you, Eros\"). The depiction of the charioteer shows great attention to realism, as do the depictions of the horses, two of which are named Amandus and Frunitus after their characters. The horses are arranged symmetrically; such symmetries were very popular at the time. The charioteer is holding a whip, a crown made of branches and a palm branch. The starting blocks of the circus can be seen in the background. This work of art was found in a private residence and it appears that it must be interpreted as a monument donated by the owner celebrating the victory of a charioteer named Eros.\nThe \"Ulysses mosaic\" is a work inspired by the Odyssey: the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses to the Romans) is seen standing on a boat that is decorated with a human head and a palm branch and that has two sails and a battering ram. Ulysses's hands are tied to the main mast so that he will not succumb to the fatal charm of the sirens' music. Ulysses's companions are seated around him, their ears blocked with wax as described in the legend. Three sirens stand at the base of a rocky crag. They are depicted with the upper body of a woman but the wings and legs of a bird. One of them holds a flute, the second a lyre, while the third, who does not carry an instrument, is believed to be the singing siren. In front of Ulysses's boat, there is a small barque with a fisherman holding a lobster, the depiction of which is over-sized. The mosaic has been dated to around AD 260–268; it was discovered in the \"House of Ulysses and the Pirates\".\nThe mosaic \"Neptune and the pirates\" originates from the same peristyle as the preceding work. It depicts the punishment of pirates on the Tyrrhenian Sea, merging themes linked to Dionysus and more common marine themes. The god is standing, ready to throw his spear. He is supported by a maenad, a satyr and aged Silenus, who is holding the ship's rudder. A leopard is attacking one of the pirates, who are transformed into dolphins as soon as they recognize the divine nature of their adversary. To the left, genii have boarded another ship, while to the right, fishermen are attempting to catch an octopus with a net.\nYacoub attributes a protective function to these two scenes, a means of invoking fate, a practice which is probably based on Hellenic tradition.\nThe mosaic of the \"cyclopses forging Jupiter's thunderbolts\" from the floor of a frigidarium depicts three cyclopses: Brontes, Steropes, and Pyracmon or Arges. They are depicted naked, forging Jupiter's thunderbolts, which Vulcan, seated in front of them, is holding on an anvil. This last element has been lost. The mosaic dates to the end of the 3rd century and was discovered in the \"Bath of the Cyclopses\".\n\nWorks held in other museums\nThe bilingual inscription from the mausoleum taken by the British consul Read is held by the British Museum. The Punic-Libyan Inscription shows the same text in both the Punic and the Berber languages.\n\nSee also\nNumidia\nCarthage\nRoman Africa\nRoman colonies in Berber Africa\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nGhaki, Mansour (2015), \"Toponymie et Onomastique Libyques: L'Apport de l'Écriture Punique/Néopunique\" (PDF), La Lingua nella Vita e la Vita della Lingua: Itinerari e Percorsi degli Studi Berberi, Studi Africanistici: Quaderni di Studi Berberi e Libico-Berberi, Naples: Unior, pp. 65–71, ISBN 978-88-6719-125-3, ISSN 2283-5636, archived from the original (PDF) on 2020-04-28, retrieved 2018-11-03.

      "summary": "Dougga or Thugga or TBGG (Arabic: دقة, romanized: Duqqah; Tunisian Arabic: دڨة, romanized: ) was a Berber, Punic and Roman settlement near present-day Téboursouk in northern Tunisia. The current archaeological site covers 75 hectares (190 acres). UNESCO qualified Dougga as a World Heritage Site in 1997, believing that it represents \"the best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa\". The site, which lies in the middle of the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanization, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Dougga's size, its well-preserved monuments and its rich Numidian-Berber, Punic, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history make it exceptional. Amongst the most famous monuments at the site are a Libyco-Punic Mausoleum, the Capitol, the Roman theatre, and the temples of Saturn and of Juno Caelestis.",

      "content": "Dougga (arabe : دڨة ) ou Thugga est un site archéologique situé dans la délégation de Téboursouk au Nord-Ouest de la Tunisie.\nL'Unesco a classé ce site sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en 1997, considérant qu'il s'agit de la « petite ville romaine la mieux conservée de l'Afrique du Nord ». La cité, qui se trouve en pleine campagne, est bien protégée de l'urbanisme moderne, contrairement, par exemple, à Carthage pillée et reconstruite à de nombreuses reprises.\nLe site de Dougga est remarquable par sa taille — 75 hectares — la bonne conservation de ses monuments et la richesse historique de son passé libyque, punique, numide, romano-africain et byzantin. Parmi les monuments qui font la renommée de Dougga se trouvent le mausolée libyco-punique, le Capitole, le théâtre ainsi que les temples de Saturne et de Junon Caelestis.\n\nÉtymologie\nLe nom de Dougga aurait ainsi à l'origine la même racine berbère que d'autres noms de villes du Maghreb, tels que Béja et Béjaïa ou Ksar Baghaï (Bagaï) dans les Aurès. Béjaïa est un toponyme arabe dérivé du toponyme berbère (variante kabyle) Bgayet, notamment par translittération du son ǧ en dj (ج). Ce nom berbère — qui aurait été à l'origine Tabgayet, mais dont le t initial marquant le genre féminin serait tombé en désuétude — serait issu des mots tabegga, tabeɣayt, signifiant « ronces et mûres sauvages ».\n\nLocalisation et géologie\nLe site archéologique se trouve à quelques kilomètres de la ville actuelle de Téboursouk, sur un plateau offrant une vue dégagée sur les plaines environnantes baignées par l'oued Khalled. La pente sur laquelle est bâtie la cité monte vers le nord et s'arrête à l'est par la falaise dite Kef Dougga. À l'est, les crêtes de la fossa regia témoignent de son statut de ville de contact entre mondes punique et berbère.\nLe site offrait donc une protection naturelle qui peut expliquer l'ancienneté de son occupation.\n\nCité africaine progressivement romanisée\nL'histoire de Dougga est surtout connue après la conquête romaine même si différents monuments pré-romains, comme une nécropole, le mausolée libyco-punique et des temples retrouvés grâce aux fouilles, attestent de l'importance de la ville avant l'arrivée des Romains.\n\nVieille cité africaine\nLe nom numide de la cité est TBGG, du libyque TBG signifiant « protéger » selon Gabriel Camps. La toponymie viendrait ainsi de façon évidente de la topographie du site, un plateau aisé à défendre. La fondation de la ville semble remonter au VIe siècle av. J.-C.. Certains historiens considèrent qu'il est possible d'identifier Dougga à une certaine Tokaï prise par un lieutenant d'Agathocle de Syracuse à la fin du IVe siècle av. J.-C. : Diodore de Sicile la présente comme « une ville d'une belle grandeur ».\n\nQuoi qu'il en soit, l'occupation humaine de ce site a été précoce et importante et a pris une forme urbaine comme en témoignent la présence d'une nécropole à dolmens, le plus ancien témoignage archéologique de Dougga, d'un sanctuaire à Ba'al Hammon, de stèles votives néo-puniques, du mausolée, de fragments architecturaux et d'un temple dédié à Massinissa divinisé dont des vestiges ont été retrouvés lors des fouilles.\nSi les connaissances de la ville avant la conquête romaine restent très fragmentaires, l'archéologie a fortement renouvelé récemment la représentation qui a été faite de cette époque. Ainsi, l'identification du temple à Massinissa sous le forum a infirmé la théorie de Louis Poinssot qui situe la ville numide sur le plateau et l'imagine séparée de la nouvelle ville romaine. Le temple, élevé en 10 de Micipsa ce qui correspond à l'année 139 av. J.-C., mesure plus de 14 mètres de longueur sur 6,3 mètres de largeur. Il montre que le quartier du forum a été urbanisé avant l'arrivée des colons romains.\n\nUn habitat du IIe siècle av. J.-C. a aussi été retrouvé à proximité. De même, le célèbre mausolée de Dougga n'est pas situé en pleine campagne mais dans une nécropole urbaine. En revanche, les fouilles récentes ont complètement bouleversé la chronologie de ce que l'on appelle couramment les « murailles numides ». Les murailles qui entourent Dougga ne sont en effet pas numides mais constituent une portion de la fortification de Dougga datant de l'Antiquité tardive. Des fouilles précises ont ainsi montré que ce qui est interprété comme deux tours numides dans la muraille sont en fait deux monuments funéraires d'époque numide réutilisés bien plus tard comme fondation et portion de l'enceinte à basse époque.\nLa découverte d'inscriptions libyques et puniques sur le site a entraîné un débat sur l'administration de la ville à l'époque du royaume numide, le cœur du débat — l'interprétation des sources épigraphiques — se situant dans la problématique de la prise en compte de l'influence punique ou d'un rapprochement avec les Berbères. Au-delà du débat sont apparues, dès l'époque numide, des institutions locales originales distinctes d'une quelconque influence punique. Cependant, Gabriel Camps signale la présence à l'époque romaine de suffètes dans plusieurs cités dont Dougga, ce qui ne peut manquer de dénoter une influence bien postérieure à la chute de Carthage, et donc une survivance d'éléments de sa civilisation.\n\nIntégration progressive\nEn tant que vieille cité numide marquée par l'influence de Carthage, les Romains lui attribuent lors de leur conquête le statut de cité indigène (civitas).\nLa fondation de la colonie de Carthage sous le règne d'Auguste complique le statut institutionnel de Dougga. Celle-ci est en effet intégrée au territoire (pertica) de la colonie romaine de Carthage : un pagus (canton) de colons romains s'ajoute à la cité indigène. Pendant deux siècles, deux cadres civiques et institutionnels se partagent donc le même site urbain : la cité composée de pérégrins et le pagus composé de citoyens romains. Tous deux possèdent des institutions civiques : magistrats et conseil des décurions (ordo) pour la cité, conseil local à partir de la fin du Ier siècle et administrateurs locaux pour le pagus qui dépend en droit de la lointaine mais puissante colonie de Carthage.\nAvec les progrès de la romanisation, les deux communautés se rapprochent : les notables de la cité pérégrine se romanisent et reçoivent la citoyenneté romaine et, de plus en plus souvent, les deux communautés représentées par leurs deux conseils prennent des décisions en commun. Ce rapprochement est facilité par le partage d'une même culture matérielle — les deux communautés ne sont pas distinguables d'un point de vue archéologique — puis par des aménagements institutionnels. Sous le règne de Marc Aurèle, la cité reçoit le droit latin : désormais l'intégration de ses magistrats à la citoyenneté romaine est automatique et le droit de ses habitants se rapproche de celui des citoyens romains. À la même époque, le pagus des citoyens gagne une certaine autonomie par rapport à Carthage et peut recevoir des legs et posséder une caisse publique.\nCe n'est cependant que sous le règne de Septime Sévère, en 205, que les deux entités fusionnent au sein d'un municipe dit libre alors que la pertica de Carthage est réduite. Soutenue par de grandes familles de riches notables pratiquant un évergétisme parfois fastueux, défendue par des ambassades auprès de l'empereur, la vie municipale à Dougga culmine alors et la cité obtient sous le règne de Gallien le titre de colonie romaine sous le nom de Colonia Licinia Septimia Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensis. À partir du règne de Dioclétien et jusqu'à celui de Théodose l'Ancien, la cité est prospère comme en témoigne sa parure monumentale. Cependant, à partir du IVe siècle, la cité entre dans une certaine torpeur, le christianisme n'y ayant laissé que des traces modestes.\n\n« Liberté » de Dougga\nÀ partir de 205, date à laquelle la civitas et le pagus sont fondus en un seul municipe, Dougga porte le nom de Municipium Septimium Aurelium Liberum Thugga. Chaque terme d'une telle nomenclature est significatif.\n\nSeptimium et Aurelium renvoient aux noms des « fondateurs » (conditores) du municipe, la concession du statut juridique étant assimilée à la fondation d'une cité nouvelle : Septime Sévère et Caracalla dont la titulature latine est Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. En revanche, le terme de Liberum n'est pas aussi facilement interprétable. Outre le cas de Dougga, ce terme figure dans la titulature d'un certain nombre d'autres municipes créés à la même époque : Thibursicum Bure, Aulodes et Thysdrus.\nPlusieurs interprétations ont été avancées. Pour Alfred Merlin et Louis Poinssot, il faut reconnaître là le nom du dieu Liber Pater, ce dernier ayant un temple à Dougga, l'épithète Liberum succédant dans ce cas aux noms de Frugifer et de Concordia, des divinités présentes dans la titulature de Thibursicum Bure. Mais ce dernier cas est une exception : la titulature des autres municipes concernés ne contient pas de noms de divinités et l'hypothèse a donc été abandonnée. Le terme de Liberum renvoie donc à la notion de libertas (liberté). Cette interprétation est confirmée par une inscription de Dougga où l'empereur Sévère Alexandre est honoré comme conservator libertatis, l'empereur ayant conservé la liberté de Dougga. Mais quel est le contenu exact de cette liberté et que recouvre-t-elle ?\nPour Jules Toutain, il s'agit d'un type de municipe particulier, des municipes libres où le gouverneur romain n'aurait pas eu le droit de contrôler les magistrats municipaux. Rien ne laisse penser toutefois que le municipe de Dougga a pu jouir de privilèges juridiques exceptionnels comme ceux que l'on trouve pour certaines cités libres telles que Aphrodisias en Asie Mineure. Paul Veyne a donc proposé de ne voir dans la libertas de Dougga qu'une liberté idéale sans contenu juridique : l'accession au statut de municipe est vue comme la fin d'une sujétion, la cité pouvant se parer des ornamenta libertatis et la célébration de sa liberté va de pair avec l'exaltation de sa dignité : l'empereur Probus est conservator libertatis et dignitatis.\nPour reprendre les mots de Jacques Gascou, selon l'interprétation de Paul Veyne, « Liberum, dans le nom de Thugga, est un terme flatteur [...] dont une cité qui a longtemps attendu le statut municipal se plaît à se parer ». Plus récemment toutefois, l'attention a été attirée sur les aspects concrets que peut recouvrir cette liberté. Ainsi, Claude Lepelley a fait remarquer d'une part que le terme de municipe libre doit faire référence aux rapports entre la cité et Rome et d'autre part que le terme de liberté peut recouvrir des privilèges divers et partiels. On sait que le territoire de Carthage, auquel appartient le pagus des citoyens romains jusqu'en 205, a de semblables privilèges : les habitants du pagus de Dougga envoient sous le règne de Trajan une ambassade pour défendre l'immunitas perticae Carthaginiensium, c'est-à-dire l'immunité (fiscale) du territoire de Carthage. En revanche, la civitas de Dougga ne possède pas un tel privilège : toute fusion avec le pagus risque d'entraîner la perte d'une situation enviable pour les citoyens du pagus. La liberté des municipes sévériens désignerait donc l'immunité fiscale étendue à tout le municipe à l'occasion de la fusion, immunité permise par la générosité de Septime Sévère et la très grande richesse de la région. Sous le règne de Gallien, l'un des grands personnages de Dougga nommé Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus effectua une ambassade auprès de l'empereur « pour assurer la liberté publique ». Pour Claude Lepelley, cela laisse penser que le privilège a été remis en question même si Dougga a finalement eu gain de cause, au moins partiellement, comme en témoigne l'inscription honorant « Probus, défenseur de sa liberté ».\n\nPour Michel Christol, cette interprétation réduit cependant le sens du mot libertas à des situations trop concrètes. Selon lui, il ne faut pas oublier que la décision de l'empereur en 205 doit répondre à une demande venant de la civitas et tenir compte des relations qui ont pu exister entre celle-ci et le pagus. L'autonomie acquise par la civitas, sous le règne de Marc Aurèle, et la concession du droit latin ont en effet rendu la perspective de la fusion des deux communautés possible mais sans doute inquiétante pour le pagus qui aurait exprimé un « souci de défense et même de refus, devant les prétentions des voisins les plus proches ». Cela expliquerait que ce dernier a honoré Commode comme conservator pagi (conservateur protecteur) du pagus.\nDès lors, l'apparition du terme Liberum serait à comprendre dans ce contexte et le terme de liberté retrouverait un aspect abstrait : la liberté est ce qui se dégage de l'appartenance à une cité et le mot de Liberum permet d'exprimer la fin de la dépendance pour la civitas, « l'élévation à la liberté des Romains d'une communauté pérégrine » qui peut effacer aussi les craintes des habitants du pagus et ouvrir, à terme, la voie vers la promotion ultime, c'est-à-dire le titre de colonie. Cette promotion a eu lieu sous le règne de Gallien, en 261, à la suite, selon Michel Christol, de l'ambassade d'Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus. Dès lors, la défense de la libertas publica par ce dernier ne serait pas à comprendre comme la défense d'un privilège menacé mais comme la demande de la « liberté suprême » (summa libertas) qu'est la promotion coloniale. Michel Christol attire aussi l'attention sur le caractère abstrait de termes tels que libertas ou dignitas : les situations vécues par les cités étaient en revanche plus concrètes et chaque fois singulières.\n\nPlan général de la cité\nLa cité telle qu'elle se présente aujourd'hui consiste essentiellement en des vestiges d'époque romaine datant principalement des IIe et IIIe siècles. Les constructions romaines ont dû prendre en compte à la fois le relief du terrain particulièrement accidenté et les constructions préexistantes, ne respectant pas de ce fait le plan orthonormé traditionnel, particulièrement en œuvre dans les créations telles que la cité de Timgad.\nLes fouilles récentes confirment la continuité de l'emprise urbaine de la cité. Le cœur de la cité resta le point culminant de la colline au cours de son histoire, le forum romain succédant à l'agora numide. Au fur et à mesure de son développement, les constructions occupèrent le flanc de la colline, la ville devant apparaître selon Hédi Slim comme « une masse compacte ».\n\nCité des vivants\nLes premières habitations privées qui sont dégagées le sont le plus souvent au début des fouilles, du fait des sondages effectués afin de découvrir les constructions publiques. Par la suite, un certain nombre de fouilles a permis de mettre en évidence quelques bâtisses privées particulièrement caractéristiques.\n\nHabitat d'époque numide\nDes traces d'habitat d'époque numide ont été décelées dans les soubassements de l'auditorium du temple de Liber Pater mais sont très ténues. Les premiers archéologues, dont Louis Poinssot, pensent à une localisation différente des villes romaine et pré-romaine, ce qui a été infirmé par cette découverte, la ville ayant eu vraisemblablement une emprise sur la même zone.\n\nExemple de maison patricienne : la villa du trifolium\nL'habitat de la ville des IIe et IIIe siècles se situe en contrebas de la ville haute qui abrite le forum ainsi que les principaux monuments publics de la ville, autour de rues au tracé irrégulier.\nLa villa dite du trifolium, du nom d'une pièce en forme de trèfle qui sert sans doute de triclinium, est la plus grande maison privée fouillée à l'heure actuelle sur le site de Dougga. Elle possède deux étages mais il ne reste presque rien du second niveau. Située au sud du site, à mi-hauteur de la pente naturelle, elle est particulièrement intéressante car elle épouse le relief du terrain : le vestibule descend vers une cour autour de laquelle s'ordonnent les différentes pièces.\n\nMarché\nLe marché (macellum) daté du milieu du Ier siècle est constitué d'une place de 35,50 mètres sur 28 mètres, entourée de portiques et de boutiques sur deux de ses côtés. Le côté nord est bordé par un portique et une exèdre qui occupe sa partie sud doit abriter une statue de Mercure.\nAfin de pallier les différences de relief, les bâtisseurs ont procédé à d'importants travaux de terrassement. La datation des vestiges en fait l'un des apports romains les plus anciens et son orientation par rapport au forum laisse supposer l'absence de plan de construction préalable. Il ne faut toutefois pas se laisser méprendre par la proximité actuelle des vestiges car il n'y a aucune connexion avec le forum.\nLors des travaux d'aménagement du fortin byzantin, le marché a été presque complètement démoli. Il a été fouillé et dégagé en 1918-1919.\n\nCité des morts\nDolmens\nLa présence de dolmens en Afrique du Nord a alimenté des débats historiographiques qui ne sont pas dénués d'arrière-pensées idéologiques. Les dolmens présents sur le site de Dougga ont fait l'objet de fouilles, des squelettes ainsi que des céramiques modelées ainsi ont pu être découverts.\n\nMême si leur datation pose un problème, du fait d'une utilisation qui a pu perdurer jusqu'au début de l'ère chrétienne, il est probable que celle-ci ne soit pas postérieure aux deux premiers millénaires av. J.-C.. Gabriel Camps a envisagé une origine sicilienne pour ce type de sépulture ainsi que pour les sépultures dites haouanet.\n\nTombes à bazina d'époque numide\nUn type de tombe propre au monde numide a été découvert sur le site : il s'agit des tombes dites à bazina ou monuments circulaires.\n\nMausolée libyco-punique\nIl s'agit de l'un des très rares exemples d'architecture royale numide, un autre exemple se situant à Sabratha dans l'actuelle Libye. Certains auteurs y ont vu une parenté avec l'architecture funéraire d'Asie Mineure et les nécropoles alexandrines des IIIe et IIe siècles av. J.-C..\nCe tombeau de 21 mètres de haut bâti au IIe siècle av. J.-C. a été considéré comme dédié à Atban, fils de Iepmatath et de Palu, d'après le texte de l'inscription qui a été conservée. Cette inscription dont la localisation précise au sein du monument, sur un côté d'une fausse fenêtre du podium, n'a été tranchée que récemment n'est pas la seule car une autre inscription bilingue ornant l'autre côté de la fausse fenêtre a pour sa part été perdue. Selon ces dernières études, les noms cités ne seraient que ceux ayant construit la bâtisse, ceux de l'architecte et de représentants de divers corps de métiers. Le monument aurait été bâti par les habitants de la cité pour un prince numide, certains y ayant vu le tombeau ou un cénotaphe à destination de Massinissa.\nOn accède au tombeau par un piédestal de cinq marches. Sur la face nord du podium, premier des trois étages, une fenêtre fermée par une dalle ouvre la chambre funéraire. Les autres faces sont décorées de fausses fenêtres, les quatre pilastres d'angle étant d'ordre éolique.\nLe second niveau est constitué d'une colonnade ayant la forme d'un temple (naïskos), les colonnes engagées flanquant chaque côté étant d'ordre ionique. Le troisième et dernier niveau est le plus richement décoré : outre des pilastres d'angle similaires à ceux du premier niveau, il se termine par un pyramidion. Des éléments de statuaire perdurent également. En 1842, afin de détacher l'inscription royale qui l'orne, le consul britannique à Tunis, sir Thomas Reade, endommage très gravement le monument qui ne doit son état actuel qu'à un archéologue français, Louis Poinssot, qui en entreprit une véritable reconstruction à partir des éléments qui jonchent le sol. L'inscription bilingue libyque et punique qui se trouve quant à elle au British Museum a permis de déchiffrer les caractères libyques.\n\nSépultures d'époque romaine\nLes sépultures d'époque romaine qui ont fait l'objet de dégagements sont aujourd'hui en partie gagnées par l'espace occupé par les oliviers.\n\nLes diverses zones de nécropoles délimitent la zone d'habitation même si cette délimitation n'est pas si simple. On trouve cinq espaces identifiés comme nécropoles : la première au nord-est, autour du temple de Saturne et de l'église de Victoria, la seconde au nord-ouest, zone qui inclut également les dolmens présents sur le site, la troisième à l'ouest, entre les citernes d'Aïn Mizeb et d'Aïn El Hammam et au nord du temple de Junon Caelestis, la quatrième et la cinquième au sud et au sud-est, l'une autour du mausolée libyco-punique, l'autre autour de l'arc de triomphe de Septime Sévère.\n\nHypogée\nL'hypogée est un édifice à demi-enterré, datant du IIIe siècle, bâti au milieu d'une nécropole plus ancienne et qui a été fouillé en 1913. Destiné à accueillir des urnes funéraires dans de petites niches aménagées dans les parois, il contient lors de sa découverte des sarcophages suggérant une longue utilisation.\n\nÉdifices politiques\nArcs\nLe site de Dougga possède encore deux arcs dans un état de conservation inégal.\nL'arc de Septime Sévère, très endommagé, se situe à proximité du mausolée libyco-punique et se trouve relié à la voie menant de Carthage à Théveste. Son érection est datée de l'année 205.\nQuant à l'arc de Sévère Alexandre, daté des années 222-235, il est relativement bien conservé — en dépit de la perte de ses parties supérieures — et se situe à égale distance du Capitole et du temple de Junon Caelestis. Son arcade mesure quatre mètres.\nUn dernier arc datant de la Tétrarchie a quant à lui complètement disparu.\n\nForum\nLe forum de la cité avec ses 924 m2 est à la fois petit et inégalement préservé, la forteresse byzantine ayant endommagé une grande partie des bâtiments le constituant. Le Capitole intégré sur l'aire entourée de portiques écrase en quelque sorte les autres éléments de par sa présence imposante, et au premier chef tout autre élément pouvant être utilisé par les institutions locales. La présence de la place de la Rose des vents — du nom de l'élément de décoration y figurant — ne parvient pas à donner de l'espace à cette place publique et ne sert en quelque sorte que comme esplanade au temple de Mercure la bordant au nord. Sur l'un des côtés de la place doit se situer la curie de la cité ainsi qu'une tribune aux harangues.\nTrès longtemps, les archéologues ont pensé à une création ex nihilo mais cette thèse est clairement contredite par la présence d'un sanctuaire dédié à Massinissa divinisé dont les substructions ont été dégagées récemment à l'arrière du Capitole.\n\nÉdifices de loisirs\nThéâtre\nCe type d'édifice apparaît dès le règne d'Auguste comme un élément fondamental de la parure monumentale d'une cité.\nLe théâtre, construit en 168 ou 169, est l'un des mieux conservés d'Afrique romaine et peut accueillir 3 500 spectateurs alors que Dougga ne compte que 5 000 habitants. Il appartient à une série de bâtiments publics impériaux dont la construction s'étale sur deux siècles et qui ne présentent que peu de différences par rapport à un modèle théorique, si ce n'est l'adaptation au terrain, des aménagements mineurs ou l'ornementation pour lesquels les architectes locaux ont pu avoir quelque liberté.\nD'un diamètre de 63,5 m, le théâtre s'appuie sur une colline. La cavea atteint une hauteur de 15 m et compte trois séries de gradins, neuf grands au premier niveau, six au second et quatre au niveau supérieur, soit 19 gradins au total. L'orchestra est inhabituellement petit (huit mètres de diamètre), en raison de la place prise par les cinq rangs très larges de sièges réservés aux notables. La scène mesure 36,75 m de largeur pour 5,5 m de profondeur. Le mur de scène a presque complètement disparu, il n'en subsiste qu'un soubassement avec trois exèdres, ouverts sur les trois entrées des acteurs, et plusieurs colonnes qui encadraient ces entrées.\nUne dédicace, gravée sur le fronton de la scène et sur le portique qui domine la ville, rappelle son constructeur, P. Marcius Quadratus, qui « a construit de ses deniers pour sa patrie » l'édifice et offert à l'occasion de la dédicace « des représentations scéniques, des distributions de vivre, un festin et des jeux gymniques ».\nLe théâtre est encore animé de pièces classiques notamment lors du Festival international de Dougga et fait l'objet de travaux de conservation.\n\nAuditorium\nLe lieu dénommé auditorium est une annexe du temple de Liber Pater qui doit vraisemblablement servir de lieu pour l'initiation de novices. Ce n'est donc un lieu de spectacle que par la forme du bâtiment, un petit théâtre de 20 mètres sur 20 mètres, et non par la fonction qui lui est dévolue.\n\nCirque\nLa cité possède un cirque romain destiné aux courses de chars mais celui-ci n'est plus guère visible sur le site au travers d'une longue dépression au nord-ouest. Au départ, le lieu n'est pas réellement construit : l'inscription du temple de la Victoire germanique de Caracalla, qui nous apprend qu'il s'agit d'un terrain donné par les Gabinii en 214, l'évoque comme un ager qui appellatur circus (champ qui tient lieu de cirque). En 225 toutefois, il est aménagé et construit aux frais des édiles à la suite d'une promesse de leur part et sur la demande du peuple tout entier. Cette construction chercha à tirer le plus possible parti de la topographie, souci d'économie compréhensible pour une ville moyenne aux revenus limités mais aussi sans doute volonté de finir au plus vite les travaux, les magistrats n'exerçant qu'un mandat annuel. La construction doit avoir cependant « quelque envergure » et, avec une longueur de 393 mètres et une spina longue de 190 mètres et large de 6 mètres, elle est assez exceptionnelle en Afrique du Nord : Dougga prend place avec ce bâtiment parmi les plus importantes cités de la province, aux côtés de Carthage, Thysdrus, Leptis Magna, Hadrumète et Utique. Le don du terrain pour le plaisir du peuple (ad voluptatem populi) et son aménagement à la suite de la demande du peuple tout entier (postulante universo populo) rappellent l'importance des spectacles dans la vie sociale des cités et l'exigence du divertissement populaire.\n\nAmphithéâtre\nLa question de la présence d'un amphithéâtre de Dougga n'est pas définitivement tranchée. Traditionnellement, une vaste dépression située au nord-ouest du site et de forme elliptique est interprétée comme le site d'un amphithéâtre. Les archéologues actuels sont toutefois beaucoup plus prudents sur la question.\n\nThermes\nTrois espaces thermaux ont été totalement dégagés alors qu'un autre est en cours de fouilles. Parmi ces quatre thermes, l'un est inclus dans une maison privée, les « thermes de la maison à l'ouest du temple de Tellus ».\nDeux autres, les thermes d'Aïn Doura et les thermes longtemps dénommés « thermes liciniens », sont des lieux ouverts au public au vu de leur superficie. Le dernier lieu, les thermes des Cyclopes, est plus complexe à interpréter.\n\nThermes des Cyclopes\nAu cours du dégagement des thermes des Cyclopes a été découverte la mosaïque des cyclopes forgeant les foudres de Jupiter qui est exposée désormais au musée national du Bardo. Des latrines en très bon état de conservation y sont également visibles. L'édifice a été daté du IIIe siècle de par l'étude de cette mosaïque.\nLa taille de l'édifice, avec un frigidarium de moins de 30 m2 a poussé certains à en faire un espace thermal privé. Cependant, le rattachement à une domus dans son environnement immédiat pose un problème, la « villa du trifolium » étant éloignée et les autres vestiges les plus proches étant d'une interprétation difficile de par la médiocrité de leur état de conservation. Yvon Thébert opte donc pour l'hypothèse d'en faire des bains de quartier.\n\nThermes antoniniens ou liciniens\nQuant aux thermes antoniniens du IIIe siècle, ils ont été longtemps appelés liciniens, avec une construction datant du règne de Gallien, et possèdent encore plusieurs étages. L'identification réalisée par Louis Poinssot, basée sur la prospérité de Dougga à l'époque et sur l'interprétation d'inscriptions lacunaires, a été remise en cause par les recherches récentes en particulier celles de Michel Christol. Ce dernier a proposé une datation du règne de Caracalla désormais confirmée par l'épigraphie. D'autres ont même avancé une datation du règne des Sévères, du fait d'une particularité qui se répand un siècle plus tard en Occident, les colonnes situées dans le péristyle nord-ouest portant des dais supportant eux-mêmes des arcs.\nLes thermes sont transformés en huilerie à une époque inconnue.\nDe taille moyenne, le plan de l'édifice est symétrique et de taille moyenne avec environ 1 700 m2 de superficie hors les palestres, dont 175 m2 pour le seul frigidarium. La construction a nécessité de gros travaux de nivellement et de remblai de la pente, cet élément pouvant expliquer la différence de conservation car l'espace bâti sur le remblai a largement disparu.\n\nThermes d'Aïn Doura\nDans l'environnement immédiat d'Aïn Doura se trouve un espace en voie de dégagement qui pourrait révéler les thermes les plus grands de la ville. La datation proposée pour la construction de cet ensemble est la fin du IIe siècle et le début du IIIe siècle, selon le style des mosaïques retrouvées, avec une phase de réaménagement du seul décor mosaïcal au IVe siècle.\nL'ensemble thermal est très incomplètement fouillé mais il apparaît, selon Yvon Thébert, qu'il s'agit d'un ensemble à plan symétrique dont seule une portion des salles froides a été dégagée.\n\nThermes de la maison à l'ouest du temple de Tellus\nCe petit espace thermal de 75 m2, accessible depuis la maison et la rue, a été dégagé au début du XXe siècle. Yvon Thébert n'en propose pas de datation mais l'analyse archéologique de sa relation avec la maison l'abritant lui a fait énoncer qu'il résulterait d'un aménagement postérieur à la construction primitive.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nLa petite cité est dotée d'un nombre important de temples. Plus d'une vingtaine de temples sont attestés archéologiquement ou épigraphiquement : onze temples le sont par l'épigraphie et l'archéologie, huit ne sont connus que par l'archéologie et quatorze ne le sont que par l'épigraphie. Cette multiplication est due en particulier aux manifestations d'évergétisme de familles aisées.\n\nTemple de Massinissa divinisé\nLe temple de Massinissa divinisé se situe sur la bordure occidentale du Capitole. Les vestiges sont identifiés par les premiers fouilleurs comme ceux d'une fontaine monumentale, bien qu'une inscription monumentale prouvant l'existence d'un sanctuaire au défunt roi numide a été mise au jour dès 1904. Cette inscription est datée de 139 av. J.-C., sous le règne de Micipsa.\nLes vestiges possèdent une parenté architecturale avec le temple de Chemtou et témoignent de la même localisation entre le centre politique de la ville romaine et l'agora hellénistique. Les vestiges lapidaires retrouvés dans le secteur du forum semblent appartenir à plusieurs édifices de même époque, alors que la localisation précise du sanctuaire est encore débattue.\nEn outre, l'idée d'un tel sanctuaire qui divinise le souverain n'est pas acceptée par tous les chercheurs : Stéphane Gsell y voit un prolongement des pratiques orientales et hellénistiques, alors que Gabriel Camps nuance cette thèse en se fondant sur l'absence de sources antiques témoignant autre chose qu'un simple respect des sujets envers leur roi. L'édifice serait uniquement un lieu de mémoire, un lieu de culte funéraire. La construction après dix ans de règne s'expliquerait par son sens politique : Micipsa, seul à régner après le décès de ses frères Gulussa et Mastanabal, aurait ainsi affirmé l'unité de son royaume autour de la personne du roi.\n\nCapitole\nLe Capitole est un temple romain du IIe siècle principalement dédié à la triade protectrice de Rome : Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Junon Regina et Minerve Augusta. Il est dédié de manière secondaire à la sauvegarde des empereurs Lucius Aurelius Verus et Marc Aurèle ; il a sans doute été achevé en 166-167 vu leur titulature.\nIdentifié comme temple de Jupiter dès le XVIIe siècle par Thomas d'Arcos, l'édifice fait l'objet d'études dès la fin du XIXe siècle, en particulier par le docteur Louis Carton en 1893. Les murs en opus africanum et l'entablement du portique ont été restaurés entre 1903 et 1910. Claude Poinssot y a découvert une crypte sous le sol de la cella en 1955. Les derniers travaux ont été effectués par l'Institut national du patrimoine tunisien entre 1994 et 1996.\nL'état de conservation exceptionnel du site peut s'expliquer par son inclusion dans une fortification byzantine. Un escalier de onze marches mène au portique de façade. Les colonnes corinthiennes de la façade s'élèvent à huit mètres de haut, au-dessus desquelles se trouve le fronton en parfait état. Il conserve une représentation de l'apothéose de l'empereur Antonin le Pieux enlevé par un aigle.\nLe fond de la cella comporte encore les emplacements pour trois statues destinées au culte. Dans celui du centre se dresse une statue colossale de Jupiter. Pour la crypte, la découverte d'une tête de statue de Jupiter a fait envisager à Claude Poinssot une datation de l'époque du triomphe du christianisme. Sophie Saint-Amans n'exclut pas un aménagement du temps de la construction de la citadelle byzantine, le forum et le Capitole en constituant le centre névralgique.\nLa construction du Capitole de Dougga est concomitante avec celle d'autres édifices du même type en Afrique du Nord. Cette vague peut s'expliquer, selon Pierre Gros, par une plus grande proximité du culte impérial et de celui de Jupiter.\nAux abords se situent la place de la Rose des vents — du nom des divers vents soufflant à cet endroit et gravés sur le pavage — ainsi que les vestiges de la citadelle byzantine qui reprend une partie des ruines à l'époque tardive du recul de la cité.\n\nTemple de Mercure\nLe temple de Mercure est dédié également à Tellus et fait face au marché de la cité dont il est séparé par la place de la Rose des vents. Très ruiné, il possède trois cellae. Il ne comporte pas de cour et le sanctuaire est établi sur un faible podium, un escalier de quatre marches en permettant l'accès. Il a été fouillé et consolidé entre 1904 et 1908.\n\nTemple de la Piété Auguste\nLe petit temple de la Piété Auguste a été bâti sous le règne d'Hadrien, grâce à  l'évergétisme d'un certain Caius Pompeius Nahanius. Il fait face à la place de la Rose des vents. Il en subsiste une partie du vestibule alors qu'à l'arrière, sur les soubassements du temple de Fortuna, Vénus Concordia et Mercure, a été construite une petite mosquée, seul vestige subsistant de nos jours du petit village qui a perduré jusqu'à la construction de la Nouvelle Dougga.\nIl a été identifié dès 1631 par Thomas d'Arcos grâce à une inscription encore en place à cette époque. Le podium en est relativement bas (1 mètre à 1,5 mètre) et un accès se fait par sept marches se présentant sur le côté sud.\n\nTemple de Minerve\nLe culte de Minerve a été à l'honneur dans la cité de Dougga, puisque deux sanctuaires y sont consacrés. Un premier temple de la fin du Ier siècle lui a été offert par le patron de la civitas.\nMais le lieu le plus important consacré à cette divinité est l'édifice qui comporte un temple et une aire entourée de portiques datant du règne d'Antonin le Pieux. Il est dû à l'évergétisme d'une prêtresse du culte impérial ou flaminique perpétuelle Iulia Paula Laenatiana. Il utilise la pente du terrain car le podium se situe au niveau des toits des portiques et le temple stricto sensu se situe hors de la place, l'escalier d'accès empiétant sur celle-ci et accentuant l'aspect inaccessible de la divinité.\n\nTemple des Victoires de Caracalla\nParmi les édifices religieux, le temple des Victoires de Caracalla est le seul édifice dédié au culte impérial à avoir été localisé avec précision. Connu dès 1835 par les fragments de l'inscription de son linteau, il n'a été identifié qu'en 1966. Il est adossé à un nymphée monumental datant du règne de Commode. Le nom exact du temple a été précisé par la découverte de nouveaux fragments de son inscription à la fin des années 1990 ; l'appellation qui était auparavant retenue était celle de « temple de la Victoire germanique ».\n\nL'édifice, de taille relativement limitée, a un plan original. Long de 41,5 mètres et large de 14,2 mètres, le temple est situé le long de la voie descendant du forum aux thermes d'Aïn Dora. Il occupe toute la largeur de la cour où il se trouve et est associé à un arc de triomphe qui enjambe la voie qui le longe. Devant le perron du temple, la cour s'organise autour d'un pavement en croix définissant quatre bassins recueillant les eaux de pluie. À l'intérieur du sanctuaire, la cella comporte six niches latérales accueillant des bases pour les statues d'Apollon, Liber Pater, Neptune, Mercure et de deux dieux dont on a perdu la trace. La façade, qui donne sur la cour, et les deux autres côtés sont mitoyens. Le temple est visible de loin, mais n'offre au passant que la face visible et très allongée de la cella, posée sur un soubassement en grand appareil à bossage et rythmée par sept colonnes jusqu'à la porte latérale donnant sur le perron. Le temple est d'ordre toscan tétrastyle in antis. Il s'agit d'un dispositif original : les temples du culte impérial sont en général d'ordre corinthien, placés au centre d'une vaste cour à portiques ; l'ordre toscan est ainsi très rare en province. Le temple des Victoires témoigne donc de la volonté de construire un édifice différent des autres, sans doute en réponse aux contraintes du terrain. On connaît les circonstances de sa construction grâce à sa dédicace très précisément datée de 214 qui consacre le temple aux Victoires divinisées — il s'agissait sans doute des victoires britannique, parthique et germanique de l'empereur — pour le salut de Caracalla et de sa mère Julia Domna.\nLe texte se fait l'écho des projets militaires du fils de Septime Sévère et de leur célébration dans le cadre du culte impérial. Cette inscription enseigne aussi que la construction du temple, pour une valeur de 100 000 sesterces, a été ordonnée dans son testament par une grande dame de Dougga nommée Gabinia Hermiona. Outre la munificence de cet acte d'évergétisme, le testament prévoit aussi, aux frais de ses héritiers, un banquet annuel offert aux décurions au jour anniversaire de la dédicace du temple. En même temps, Hermiona lègue « pour le plaisir du peuple » le terrain du cirque.\nLe temple occupe sans doute l'une des dernières places libres à proximité du forum. La donatrice a préféré ce terrain au centre de la ville à ceux qu'elle possède en périphérie : celui du cirque ou celui sur lequel est plus tard bâti le temple à Céleste. La famille de Gabinia, l'une des plus grandes et des plus riches familles de Dougga, est implantée parmi les notables de Carthage et conserva sa puissance à Dougga, même durant le resserrement de l'aristocratie locale au IIIe siècle : les termes mêmes du testament de Gabinia témoignent bien de ce souci de permanence, le banquet annuel conservant la mémoire de la générosité de la famille et mettant en scène la sociabilité des notables comme le cirque ordonne les plaisirs des habitants les plus humbles.\nÀ la fin du IVe siècle, le temple des Victoires est transformé en église, les bassins de la cour sont comblés pour offrir de la place aux fidèles et des chancels sont ajoutés dans la cella qui voit aussi sa décoration modifiée.\n\nTemple dit « de Pluton »\nPluton est particulièrement honoré à Dougga comme divinité poliade, ce que montre son Genius Thuggae, le génie de Dougga.\nLe temple dit « de Pluton » se trouve à proximité de l'arc de triomphe de Septime Sévère, dans un quartier peu dégagé jusqu'à présent. Cependant, l'hypothèse est très fragile et ne repose que sur la découverte d'un buste dans la cour, qui a été daté par Claude Poinssot des IIe et IIIe siècles, découverte que les dernières recherches ne retiennent plus comme probantes. L'édifice a été fouillé dans les années 1960 et les conditions du dégagement et des stabilisations de l'édifice sont obscures. Au milieu d'une cour, sur un podium, se trouve une cella munie d'une seule niche. L'autel a également été conservé.\nUne étude architecturale a eu lieu entre 2000 et 2002 mais n'a pas conduit à des fouilles étendues. Une fouille pratiquée en 2001, au voisinage de l'autel, a montré que le quartier était probablement occupé à l'époque pré-romaine. Le sanctuaire présente deux états distincts, la cour ayant été agrandie dans le second état, peut-être dans des opérations d'embellissement du quartier lors de la construction de l'arc de Septime Sévère.\n\nTemple de Saturne\nSaturne est l'héritier du Ba'al Hammon punique et le parèdre de Tanit ou Junon Caelestis. À l'époque romaine, la ville de Dougga possède au moins deux sanctuaires dédiés à Saturne. L'un d'eux est surtout connu par des documents épigraphiques. Le second, que l'on désigne couramment comme le temple de Saturne de Dougga, a été bien dégagé par les recherches archéologiques.\nLes vestiges de ce temple, peu importants comparés à ceux du Capitole et du temple de Junon Caelestis, sont particulièrement intéressants par leur environnement, les ruines se dressant sur un promontoire avec vue sur la riche vallée céréalière de l'oued Khalled, à 160 mètres du théâtre, hors des limites de la ville. Lors des fouilles ont été découverts les vestiges d'un temple de Ba'al Hammon, en particulier des favissæ contenant des ex-votos. Le temple construit à l'époque romaine succède donc à un sanctuaire autochtone remontant au moins au IIe siècle av. J.-C. Ce sanctuaire est essentiellement constitué d'une vaste place à ciel ouvert accueillant les ex-voto et les sacrifices. Il a été remblayé pour permettre la construction du temple de Saturne dont les ruines sont aujourd'hui visibles.\nLa construction date du règne de Septime Sévère. Elle est constituée de trois cellae, d'une cour à portiques et d'un vestibule. L'eau des toits est récupérée dans des citernes. Les circonstances sont connues grâce à une inscription : le temple a été érigé à la suite d'un legs d'un notable local, nommé Lucius Octavius Victor Roscianus, pour un coût d'au moins 150 000 sesterces, prix qui semble élevé et s'explique peut-être par l'importance des remblais nécessaires, qui n'ont cependant pas réussi à donner au monument une assise suffisante : restaurations et consolidations paraissent avoir été nombreuses avant la ruine finale.\n\nTemple de Junon Caelestis\nLe temple de Junon Caelestis, bâti à la périphérie de la ville, a été décrit dès le XVIIe siècle et dégagé au cours des années 1890. Des restaurations importantes ont été entreprises entre 1904 et 1914, et de nouvelles études menées à nouveau entre 1999 et 2002.\n\nLe temple, dédié à Junon Caelestis, héritière de la Tanit punique, est remarquable en raison de l'état de conservation de son enceinte sacrée (temenos) délimitée par un mur dont une partie importante est très bien conservée. La cour est pavée en partie seulement et s'ouvre par deux portes symétriques. Un portique de 25 travées borde la partie circulaire de l'enceinte. Il est surmonté par une frise relatant sa construction.\nLe temple au sens strict se situe sur un haut podium auquel on accède par un escalier de onze marches. Il est périptère et hexastyle de l'ordre corinthien. Le fronton porte une dédicace à Sévère Alexandre. La cella a quant à elle totalement disparu.\nOn sait que la construction, étalée de 222 à 235, a été payée par un certain Q. Gabinius Rufus Felix qui y fit en outre déposer deux statues d'argent de la déesse d'un coût de 35 000 sesterces.\nLa forme de l'enceinte de ce temple du IIIe siècle de 52 mètres de diamètre évoquerait un croissant de lune, symbole de la divinité.\n\nÉdifice dénommé Dar Lacheb\nL'édifice dénommé Dar Lacheb (maison de Lacheb) n'a pas été clairement identifié même si Sophie Saint-Amans opte pour un sanctuaire dédié à Esculape, dans la continuité de l'hypothèse de Claude Poinssot qui y voit un temple.\nDégagé dès la fin du XIXe siècle par Louis Carton, il n'a plus fait l'objet de travaux depuis 1912. Une maison bâtie en utilisant des vestiges antiques réemployés s'y trouve mais a été détruite dès le début du XXe siècle.\nIl a été construit entre 164 et 166 et se trouve donc contemporain du Capitole, situé à 50 mètres de là. La porte d'accès à l'édifice est parfaitement préservée ainsi que l'une des colonnes d'un porche d'entrée. L'intérieur consiste en une cour bordée anciennement de portiques. Au sud se situe la cella d'un temple entièrement disparu.\n\nÉglise de Victoria\nL'église de Victoria, qui se situe au nord-est du site, en contrebas du temple de Saturne, est le seul édifice chrétien révélé par les fouilles jusqu'à présent. À la fin du IVe siècle ou au début du Ve siècle, la communauté chrétienne installa dans un cimetière païen une petite église martyriale au plan irrégulier. À proximité se trouve le petit hypogée.\n\nInfrastructures\nCiternes et aqueduc\nLe site de Dougga possède encore deux beaux ensembles de citernes, au nord et à l'ouest, dont l'un est particulièrement bien préservé. Un aqueduc menant à la cité, localisé à une très faible distance de celle-ci, compte parmi les monuments de ce type les mieux conservés de la Tunisie actuelle.\nLes six citernes d'Aïn El Hammam, situées à proximité du temple de Junon Caelestis, peuvent contenir 6 000 m3 et sont particulièrement ruinées. Elles sont alimentées par une source située à 12 kilomètres et un aqueduc construit sous le règne de Commode et restauré dans le dernier quart du IVe siècle.\nCe lieu est encore utilisé une fois par an pour une manifestation populaire, la fête de Mokhola, une sainte dispensatrice de bienfaits parvenue ici en provenance du Maroc selon la tradition orale. La vénération s'accompagne de sacrifices d'animaux. Il a été démontré que cette tradition est païenne, la vénération se portant vers la source d'origine, appelée fons moccolitanus.\nLe second ensemble, les citernes d'Aïn Mizeb, est en très bon état de conservation. Situés près du temple de Minerve, ses huit réservoirs voûtés peuvent contenir 9 000 m3 dont un bassin de décantation apposé. Ces réservoirs sont alimentés par une source située à 200 mètres et un aqueduc souterrain.\nUn dernier ensemble de citernes secondaires se situe à proximité des thermes d'Aïn Doura, au sud-ouest du site.\n\nVoies de circulation\nLes voies de circulation de Dougga sont éloignées du modèle théorique — ordonnancé autour d'un cardo et d'un decumanus — du fait du plan original de la cité.\nLe centre de la cité est vraisemblablement piétonnier et les voies s'apparentent davantage à des venelles riches en méandres. Des installations d'assainissement y sont présentes comme en témoignent les plaques d'égouts encore en place. Au bas de la colline se trouvent encore les traces des routes rejoignant la grande voie de Carthage à Théveste.\n\nDécouvertes effectuées sur le site\nLe site de Dougga a livré de nombreuses œuvres dont beaucoup ont fait l'objet d'un prélèvement afin d'être déposées dans des musées, principalement au musée national du Bardo à Tunis.\n\nŒuvres in situ\nPeu d'œuvres sont restées en place à l'exception d'une sculpture de togatus sur la place de la Rose des vents et de quelques décors mosaïqués dont ceux de la maison dite de Vénus et surtout des thermes d'Aïn Doura. Cette situation tient à l'ancienneté des découvertes effectuées à une époque où les sites sont dépouillés après les fouilles de leurs œuvres et laissés à l'abandon. Cette procédure a permis de conserver avec leurs couleurs intactes un certain nombre de mosaïques, les autres mosaïques découvertes et non retirées ayant été dégradées par les intempéries.\nUn projet de constitution d'un musée sur le site serait à l'étude, notamment afin d'accueillir les œuvres découvertes lors des fouilles récentes ou à découvrir.\n\nŒuvres déposées au musée national du Bardo\nStatuaire\nUn certain nombre de têtes d'empereurs ont été retrouvées lors des fouilles. Parmi celles-ci, le portrait de Lucius Aurelius Verus a une place à part : il est représenté avec une ample coiffure, une barbe fournie et une vivacité dans le regard qui en fait l'une des œuvres majeures de la statuaire découverte à ce jour dans l'Afrique romaine. Cette œuvre africaine réalisée en marbre de Carrare possède encore des traces de polychromie dans les cheveux.\nLe musée abrite également un togatus daté du IIIe siècle : il représente un homme d'un certain âge, à la barbe rase et vêtu d'une toge. Il s'agit sans doute d'une œuvre antérieure remise au goût du jour.\n\nMosaïques\nLa mosaïque des échansons datée du milieu du IIIe siècle figure une scène de beuverie : deux personnages servent à boire à deux autres, beaucoup plus petits, à partir d'une amphore posée sur leur épaule. Sur les deux amphores se trouvent inscrites des formules : PIE (« bois ! » en latin) et ZHCHC (« tu vivras » en grec). Sur les côtés se trouvent deux autres personnages apportant une autre amphore pour l'un, un branchage de laurier et un panier de roses pour l'autre.\nCette représentation est une forme de bienvenue pour les invités et une promesse d'un bon accueil. La même thématique se retrouve sur un médaillon de mosaïque également déposé au musée du Bardo et baptisé Omnia tibi Felicia (Puisses-tu te réjouir de tout).\nLa mosaïque de l'aurige vainqueur est plus tardive, de la seconde moitié du IVe siècle, et figure l'inscription Eros omnia per te (Eros tout grâce à toi). L'aurige est figuré de face, avec un grand souci de réalisme, ainsi que des chevaux dont deux sont nommés Amandus et Frunitus, du nom de leur caractère. Ils sont ordonnés de façon symétrique, cette dernière symétrie étant très prisée à cette époque. Le personnage tient un fouet, une couronne végétale et une palme. À l'arrière-plan se trouvent les grilles de départ du cirque.\nCette œuvre retrouvée dans une demeure privée semble devoir être interprétée comme une commémoration de jeux offerts par le propriétaire et en particulier d'une victoire d'un aurige dont le nom est Eros. La mosaïque d'Ulysse est un tableau inspiré de l'Odyssée : le héros grec apparaît debout sur un bateau à deux voiles et à un rang de rame, orné d'une tête humaine et d'une palme, les mains attachées au grand mât pour éviter de succomber au charme fatal de la musique des sirènes. Autour d'Ulysse sont assis ses compagnons, les oreilles bouchées de cire comme le relate la légende. Au pied d'un escarpement rocheux se tiennent trois sirènes représentées avec un buste de femme auquel s'attachent des ailes et des pattes d'oiseaux. L'une d'elles tient une double flûte, l'autre une lyre, la troisième dépourvue d'instrument est considérée comme la sirène chanteuse. Devant le bateau se trouve une petite barque dans laquelle se situe un pêcheur tenant une langouste au format exagéré. L'œuvre est datée des environs de 260-268 et a été découverte dans la « maison d'Ulysse et les pirates ».\nLa mosaïque de Neptune et les pirates provient du même péristyle que le pavement précédent. Le thème en est le châtiment des pirates de la mer Tyrrhénienne, mêlant la thématique dionysiaque à des thèmes marins plus fréquents. Le dieu se trouve debout, prêt à jeter sa lance, et se voit soutenu par une bacchante, un satyre et un vieux silène qui tient le gouvernail du navire. Une panthère se jette sur un membre du groupe de pirates qui sont transformés en dauphins lorsqu'ils reconnaissent la nature divine de leur adversaire. À gauche, de petits génies ont embarqué sur un autre navire, tandis que sur la droite est figurée une scène de pêche au poulpe, avec un filet.\nMohamed Yacoub accorde à ces deux scènes une fonction apotropaïque, un moyen de conjurer le sort, remontant vraisemblablement à un modèle hellénistique.\nLa mosaïque des cyclopes forgeant les foudres de Jupiter est issue du pavement d'un frigidarium illustrant trois cyclopes : Brontès, Stéropès et Pyracmon. Nus, ils forgent les foudres de Jupiter que Vulcain, assis en face d'eux, maintient sur l'enclume. Cette dernière représentation a disparu. La mosaïque date de la fin du IIIe siècle et a été découverte dans les thermes des Cyclopes.\n\nŒuvres déposées dans d'autres musées\nL'inscription bilingue du mausolée libyco-punique déposée par le consul Read se trouve toujours au British Museum. Aucune restitution n'a été tentée sur le monument visible sur le site. L'inscription présente le même texte dans les langues punique et libyque.\n\nRedécouverte et avenir du site\nLa cité a semblé connaître un déclin précoce, comme en témoigne la relative pauvreté des vestiges de l'époque chrétienne. L'époque byzantine voit la zone du forum transformée en fortin et de nombreux édifices importants détruits afin de fournir des matériaux nécessaires à la construction. Cependant, le site n'a jamais été totalement abandonné et il subsiste longtemps un village peuplé par les descendants des anciens habitants, comme en témoigne encore une petite mosquée installée à l'emplacement du temple de la Piété Auguste, ainsi que de petits thermes d'époque aghlabide sur la bordure sud du forum.\nLes premiers visiteurs occidentaux ayant laissé des témoignages sur les vestiges parcourent le site dès le XVIIe siècle. Cette tendance se poursuit au XVIIIe et au début du XIXe siècle. Les monuments les mieux conservés, dont le mausolée libyco-punique, ont fait l'objet de descriptions et, à la fin de la période, d'études architecturales.\n\nLa mise en place du protectorat en 1881 voit la Tunisie se doter d'un service des antiquités, dirigé par Paul Gauckler de 1896 à 1905, qui fait du dégagement du site de Dougga une priorité dès 1901, en parallèle avec les travaux effectués à Carthage. Les travaux, initiés par Gauckler et conduits par Louis Poinssot (inspecteur des antiquités à partir de 1907 puis directeur des antiquités de 1921 à 1942), se concentrent sur la zone du forum, puis d'autres découvertes jalonnent les campagnes de fouilles, à peu près continues jusqu'en 1939. Parallèlement à ces fouilles, des travaux de restauration sont effectués au Capitole, dont ne subsistent que la façade et le mur du fond de la cella, et surtout au mausolée libyco-punique entre 1908 et 1910.\n\nAprès l'indépendance, d'autres bâtiments sont dégagés au début des années 1960, comme le temple de la Victoire germanique de Caracalla. Dans le même temps, les derniers habitants sont chassés du site et réinstallés dans un village localisé dans la plaine, à quelques kilomètres du site antique, qui porte le nom de Nouvelle Dougga. En 1991, la décision est prise de faire du site un parc archéologique national. Un programme scientifique de coopération œuvre en particulier pour la connaissance de l'épigraphie et celle des temples païens. En 1997, le site est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco. Le site, un peu à l'écart des circuits touristiques, reste assez peu visité malgré son importance et un état de conservation tout à fait exceptionnel. Pour le rendre plus attractif, la constitution d'un musée sur place est à l'ordre du jour et un site web a été mis en ligne par l'Institut national du patrimoine pour présenter le site et sa région.\nÀ l'heure actuelle, les visiteurs disposant de suffisamment de temps peuvent apprécier Dougga, non seulement pour ses vestiges, mais également pour l'environnement des oliveraies qui lui confèrent une ambiance unique.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\nFrançais\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nOuvrages généraux\nAïcha Ben Abed-Ben Khedher, Le musée du Bardo, Tunis, Cérès, 1992, 76 p.

      "summary": "Dougga (arabe : دڨة ) ou Thugga est un site archéologique situé dans la délégation de Téboursouk au Nord-Ouest de la Tunisie.\nL'Unesco a classé ce site sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en 1997, considérant qu'il s'agit de la « petite ville romaine la mieux conservée de l'Afrique du Nord ». La cité, qui se trouve en pleine campagne, est bien protégée de l'urbanisme moderne, contrairement, par exemple, à Carthage pillée et reconstruite à de nombreuses reprises.\nLe site de Dougga est remarquable par sa taille — 75 hectares — la bonne conservation de ses monuments et la richesse historique de son passé libyque, punique, numide, romano-africain et byzantin. Parmi les monuments qui font la renommée de Dougga se trouvent le mausolée libyco-punique, le Capitole, le théâtre ainsi que les temples de Saturne et de Junon Caelestis.",

      "content": "## Overview\nDougga is a small town in the north of Tunisia that holds the extensive ruins of a Roman town, set on a hilltop, overlooking surrounding valleys with olive plantations, featured on the UNESCO World Heritage list. It also has several other monuments dating from pre-Roman times. Plan to spend about 2 hours here, and if you have a car, couple it with trips to surrounding areas (ask the security guard at the ticket office for recommendations).\n\n## Understand\nThe road to Dougga passes through beautiful rural and scenic landscape. Unlike Roman ruins in Carthage or even in European towns where one or two remaining monuments are isolated in the middle of a modern city, at Dougga, the entire town is preserved, even the Roman streets. Without the barriers and the flocks of tourists, one can take one's time to climb in and out of houses and tunnels, temples and the theatres.\nAs with other sites in Tunis, Dougga's history is not limited to only the Roman period. One finds an old Punic temple here with a cleansing bath and walls from the Phoenician period, which was later transformed and reused by the Romans, and thus has Roman pillars. There is also an obvious funerary monument, the Mausoleum of Ateban, dating to 2nd century BCE, one of three examples of royal Numidian architecture. Its inscription is housed in the British Museum, and the Punic-Libyan bilingual inscription was used to translate Libyan script.\n\n## Get in\nGet a bus (at least two hours) or louage (80 minutes) to Teboursouk (pronounced Tebsook) from Bab Saadoune louage/bus station (Gare de Routiere Nord) in Tunis. A taxi will take you the short distance to Dougga and then pick you up again at an arranged time. Louage drivers often ring ahead to alert the taxi that a tourist is arriving. It's very convenient and quick but 15-20 DT for only a short distance. If you can't manage to get the price down, remember that Dougga is a memorable place to visit and well worth the money. As of July 2016, there was only one, extremely busy, taxi in Teboursouk that also served as the local bus, so arguing with the driver over the price was pointless.\nGet a bus (at least two hours) or louage (1 hour) to Teboursouk from the louage station in El Kef. The same applies.\nUse return taxi trip to get to Teboursouk because there will almost certainly be no taxis waiting to pick up passengers leaving Dougga (as it is in the middle of nowhere).\nIf you return after 2:00PM, all the buses/louage in Teboursouk might be full. You can take a cab down to Espace BICHA in Nouvelle Dougga. As buses between Tunis and El Kef stop there, you can hop on one which has empty seats. The owner can call drivers to make sure that you will fit.\nIf driving, clear sign posts pointing to the Ruins of Dougga can be followed from Tebersouk.\nYou could also go as part of an organised tour from Tunis.\n\n## Get around\nLight sandals might not be the best footwear as the paths are, for the most part, cobbled and can be  reasonably steep in places.\n\n## See\nThere are lots of buildings still partially standing. There are also few restrictions as to where you can walk. The following is a suggested route to visit.\nEntry is 7 DT plus 1 DT for photography (as of 2018). As for other archeological sites in Tunisia, expect little explanations on site.\n36.423799.22031 Theater. Built in 168 or 169 CE, is one of the best preserved examples in Roman Africa. It could seat 3500 spectators, and is the first thing one sees on entering the site. From here continue on to the capitol, which has great monolithic columns that cannot be missed.\nRoads.. On the main roads (the broad road to Carthage for example), one can see cut outs for horses not to slip, and holes in the remaining door ways to tie the horses to. Under the roads are the Roman sewers various stones on the main road can be lifted up to let the water out in times of flooding.Access to sewers\nMosque.. Tiny building with Roman columns in the interior to the left of the capitol when coming from the theatre.\nMarketplace.. Note the marks in the floor where the shop doors used to go.\nSquare of the Rose of the Winds.. Look out for the markings on the floor with the 12 winds especially the winds bringing rain from the north.\nThe Capitol.. A Roman temple from the 2nd century CE, principally dedicated to Rome's protective triad: Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Juno Regina et Minerva Augusta. Located next to the marketplace and the forum.\nForum.. Note the statue with the images of four gods on two sides.\nThe arch of Alexander Septimius.. Can be seen from far as it is well preserved. On the road towards Theveste, in Algeria (300km).\nThe temple of Caelaestis.. A little way off, through a grove of olive trees, and there is a sign pointing the way. It is dedicated to Juno Caelestis, the successor of the Punic god Tanit. Its well-preserved temenos is demarcated by a Phoenician wall, a large section of which has been very well preserved. The interior has Roman columns. On the right side is a small pit used for purification in Punic times. Temple of Caelaestis\nDar Lacheb.. Back on the main road to Carthage is a sanctuary, a temple, a gymnasium? A perfectly preserved door in any case! Two stretches of grass on the inside of this area.Dar Lachheb's door\nAntonian Baths.. Three rooms for hot, warm and cold baths. In the center of the city area and was used in winter. Two other baths exist, one outside the city center for the summer. Pass through the tunnels where the slaves used to heat the water to get to the three baths. From the room for rest with the metal grids on the floor and the mosaics, climb up the steep steps to get back to the Capitol.View of the Capitol from Antonian baths\nBrothel.. Facing the valley, somewhat halfway between Dar Lacheb and the Mausoleum of Ateban, is the brothel many small chambers around a main court. You can get to it by passing through the smaller theatre that is just below the area towards the valley, upon exiting the steps.\nMausoleum of Ateban..\nSeptimius Severus's arch.. From the brothel, continue back towards the main exit and you'll reach the arch of Septimius Severus two stumps left, but majestic. On the road that leads towards Carthage (120km).Septimius Severus's arch\n\n## Do\nTake lots of photographs, wander amongst the olive groves, sit and take in the majesty of the place.\n\n## Buy\nNo facilities on site. Don't be surprised if a local farmer/shepherd tries to sell you Roman 'artifacts'.\n\n## Eat\nSmall shady area with tables where you can buy cold drinks, snacks, postcards and use the toilets.\nThere is also a restaurant just below the south entrance that offers a single option: a prix-fixe meal (91d meal for 2, Feb. 2019) of soup, salad, and couscous. Expensive by local standards but tasty and a nice environment. The meal takes approximately an hour.\n\n## Drink\nMake sure you have a supply of water but you can buy it - and other drinks - on site. If buying from the local town make sure you get it from a reputable shop - street vendors have been known to refill empty bottled water containers with the local tap variety.\n\n## Go next\nTunis",
