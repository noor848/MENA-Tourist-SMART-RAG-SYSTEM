      "content": "Carthage (Arabic: قرطاج, ) was an ancient city in Northern Africa, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now Tunisia. Carthage was one of the most important trading hubs of the Ancient Mediterranean and one of the most affluent cities of the classical world. It became the capital city of the civilization of Ancient Carthage and later Roman Carthage.\nThe city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC. The legendary Queen Elissa, Alyssa or Dido, originally from Tyre, is regarded as the founder of the city, though her historicity has been questioned. In the myth, Dido asked for land from a local tribe, which told her that she could get as much land as an oxhide could cover. She cut the oxhide into strips and laid out the perimeter of the new city. As Carthage prospered at home, the polity sent colonists abroad as well as magistrates to rule the colonies.\nThe ancient city was destroyed in the nearly three year siege of Carthage by the Roman Republic during the Third Punic War in 146 BC. It was re-developed a century later as Roman Carthage, which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa. The question of Carthaginian decline and demise has remained a subject of literary, political, artistic, and philosophical debates in both ancient and modern histories.\nLate antique and medieval Carthage continued to play an important cultural and economic role in the Byzantine period. The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire. It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade. The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could not be used as a base by a hostile power again. It also continued to function as an episcopal see.\nThe regional power shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period, until the early 20th century, when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis, incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919. The archaeological site was first surveyed in 1830, by Danish consul Christian Tuxen Falbe. Excavations were performed in the second half of the 19th century by Charles Ernest Beulé and by Alfred Louis Delattre. The Carthage National Museum was founded in 1875 by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie. Excavations performed by French archaeologists in the 1920s first attracted attention because of the evidence they produced for child sacrifice. There has been considerable disagreement among scholars concerning whether child sacrifice was practiced by ancient Carthage. The open-air Carthage Paleo-Christian Museum has exhibits excavated under the auspices of UNESCO from 1975 to 1984. The site of the ruins is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Carthage ( KAR-thij) is the Early Modern anglicisation of Middle French Carthage /kartaʒə/, from Latin Carthāgō and Karthāgō (cf. Greek Karkhēdōn (Καρχηδών), as well as Karkhadōn (Καρχαδών), and Etruscan *Carθaza) from the Punic qrt-ḥdšt (𐤒𐤓𐤕 𐤇𐤃𐤔𐤕‎) \"new city\", implying it was a \"new Tyre\". The Latin adjective pūnicus, meaning \"Phoenician\", is reflected in English in some borrowings from Latin – notably the Punic Wars and the Punic language.\nThe Modern Standard Arabic form  (قرطاج) is an adoption of French Carthage, replacing an older local toponym reported as Cartagenna that directly continued the Latin name. It also traces back to the Punic name \"Qart-ḥadašt\", meaning \"new city\".\n\nTopography, layout, and society\nOverview\nCarthage was built on a promontory with sea inlets to the north and the south. The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between Sicily and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence. Two large, artificial harbors were built within the city, one for harboring the city's prodigious navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbors. The city had massive walls, 37 km (23 mi) long, which was longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were on the shore and so could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The 4.0 to 4.8 km (2.5 to 3 mi) of wall on the isthmus to the west were truly massive and were never penetrated.\nCarthage was one of the largest cities of the Hellenistic period and was among the largest cities in preindustrial history. Whereas by AD 14, Rome had at least 750,000 inhabitants and in the following century may have reached 1 million, the cities of Alexandria and Antioch numbered only a few hundred thousand or less. According to the history of Herodian, Carthage rivaled Alexandria for second place in the Roman empire.\n\nLayout\nThe Punic Carthage was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. It had religious areas, market places, a council house, towers, a theatre, and a huge necropolis; roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the Byrsa. Surrounding Carthage were walls \"of great strength\" said in places to rise above 13 m, being nearly 10 m thick, according to ancient authors. To the west, three parallel walls were built. The walls altogether ran for about 33 kilometres (21 miles) to encircle the city. The heights of the Byrsa were additionally fortified; this area being the last to succumb to the Romans in 146 BC. Originally the Romans had landed their army on the strip of land extending southward from the city.\nOutside the city walls of Carthage is the Chora or farm lands of Carthage. Chora encompassed a limited area: the north coastal tell, the lower Bagradas river valley (inland from Utica), Cape Bon, and the adjacent sahel on the east coast. Punic culture here achieved the introduction of agricultural sciences first developed for lands of the eastern Mediterranean, and their adaptation to local African conditions.\nThe urban landscape of Carthage is known in part from ancient authors, augmented by modern digs and surveys conducted by archeologists. The \"first urban nucleus\" dating to the seventh century, in area about 10 hectares (25 acres), was apparently located on low-lying lands along the coast (north of the later harbours). As confirmed by archaeological excavations, Carthage was a \"creation ex nihilo\", built on 'virgin' land, and situated at what was then the end of a peninsula. Here among \"mud brick walls and beaten clay floors\" (recently uncovered) were also found extensive cemeteries, which yielded evocative grave goods like clay masks. \"Thanks to this burial archaeology we know more about archaic Carthage than about any other contemporary city in the western Mediterranean.\" Already in the eighth century, fabric dyeing operations had been established, evident from crushed shells of murex (from which the 'Phoenician purple' was derived). Nonetheless, only a \"meager picture\" of the cultural life of the earliest pioneers in the city can be conjectured, and not much about housing, monuments, or defenses. The Roman poet Virgil (70–19 BC) imagined early Carthage, when his legendary character Aeneas had arrived there:\n\n\"Aeneas found, where lately huts had been,\nmarvelous buildings, gateways, cobbled ways,\nand din of wagons. There the Tyrians\nwere hard at work: laying courses for walls,\nrolling up stones to build the citadel,\nwhile others picked out building sites and plowed\na boundary furrow. Laws were being enacted,\nmagistrates and a sacred senate chosen.\nHere men were dredging harbors, there they laid\nthe deep foundations of a theatre,\nand quarried massive pillars... .\"\n\nThe two inner harbors, named cothon in Punic, were located in the southeast; one being commercial, and the other for war. Their definite functions are not entirely known, probably for the construction, outfitting, or repair of ships, perhaps also loading and unloading cargo. Larger anchorages existed to the north and south of the city. North and west of the cothon were located several industrial areas, e.g., metalworking and pottery (e.g., for amphora), which could serve both inner harbors, and ships anchored to the south of the city.\nConsidering the importance of the Byrsa, the citadel area to the north, our knowledge of it is patchy. Its prominent heights were the scene of fierce combat during the fiery destruction of the city in 146 BC. The Byrsa was the reported site of the Temple of Eshmun (the healing god), at the top of a stairway of sixty steps. A temple of Tanit (the city's queen goddess) was likely situated on the slope of the 'lesser Byrsa' immediately to the east, which runs down toward the sea. Also situated on the Byrsa were luxury homes.\nSouth of the citadel, near the cothon was the tophet, a special and very old cemetery, which when begun lay outside the city's boundaries. Here the Salammbô was located, the Sanctuary of Tanit, not a temple but an enclosure for placing stone stelae. These were mostly short and upright, carved for funeral purposes. The presence of infant skeletons from here may indicate the occurrence of child sacrifice, as claimed in the Bible and Greco-Roman sources, although there has been considerable doubt among archeologists as to this interpretation and many consider it simply a cemetery devoted to infants. Probably the tophet burial fields were \"dedicated at an early date, perhaps by the first settlers.\" Recent studies, on the other hand, indicate that child sacrifice was practiced by the Carthaginians.  According to K.L. Noll, many scholars believe that child sacrifice took place in Carthage.\nBetween the sea-filled cothon for shipping and the Byrsa heights lay the agora [Greek: \"market\"], the city-state's central marketplace for business and commerce. The agora was also an area of public squares and plazas, where the people might formally assemble, or gather for festivals. It was the site of religious shrines, and the location of whatever were the major municipal buildings of Carthage. Here beat the heart of civic life. In this district of Carthage, more probably, the ruling suffets presided, the council of elders convened, the tribunal of the 104 met, and justice was dispensed at trials in the open air.\nEarly residential districts wrapped around the Byrsa from the south to the north east. Houses usually were whitewashed and blank to the street, but within were courtyards open to the sky. In these neighborhoods multistory construction later became common, some up to six stories tall according to an ancient Greek author. Several architectural floorplans of homes have been revealed by recent excavations, as well as the general layout of several city blocks. Stone stairs were set in the streets, and drainage was planned, e.g., in the form of soakaways leaching into the sandy soil. Along the Byrsa's southern slope were located not only fine old homes, but also many of the earliest grave-sites, juxtaposed in small areas, interspersed with daily life.\nArtisan workshops were located in the city at sites north and west of the harbours. The location of three metal workshops (implied from iron slag and other vestiges of such activity) were found adjacent to the naval and commercial harbours, and another two were further up the hill toward the Byrsa citadel. Sites of pottery kilns have been identified, between the agora and the harbours, and further north. Earthenware often used Greek models. A fuller's shop for preparing woolen cloth (shrink and thicken) was evidently situated further to the west and south, then by the edge of the city. Carthage also produced objects of rare refinement. During the 4th and 3rd centuries, the sculptures of the sarcophagi became works of art. \"Bronze engraving and stone-carving reached their zenith.\"\nThe elevation of the land at the promontory on the seashore to the north-east (now called Sidi Bou Saïd), was twice as high above sea level as that at the Byrsa (100 m and 50 m). In between runs a ridge, several times reaching 50 m; it continues northwestward along the seashore, and forms the edge of a plateau-like area between the Byrsa and the sea. Newer urban developments lay here in these northern districts.\n\nDue to the Roman's leveling of the city, the original Punic urban landscape of Carthage was largely lost. Since 1982, French archaeologist Serge Lancel excavated a residential area of the Punic Carthage on top of Byrsa hill near the Forum of the Roman Carthage. The neighborhood can be dated back to early second century BC, and with its houses, shops, and private spaces, is significant for what it reveals about daily life of the Punic Carthage.\nThe remains have been preserved under embankments, the substructures of the later Roman forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets about 6 m (20 ft) wide, with a roadway consisting of clay; in situ stairs compensate for the slope of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, \"Hannibal district\", referring to the legendary Punic general or sufet (consul) at the beginning of the second century BC. The habitat is typical, even stereotypical. The street was often used as a storefront/shopfront; cisterns were installed in basements to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side of each residence led to a courtyard containing a sump, around which various other elements may be found. In some places, the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.\n\nSociety and local economy\nPunic culture and agricultural sciences, after arriving at Carthage from the eastern Mediterranean, gradually adapted to the local conditions. The merchant harbor at Carthage was developed after settlement of the nearby Punic town of Utica, and eventually the surrounding African countryside was brought into the orbit of the Punic urban centers, first commercially, then politically. Direct management over cultivation of neighbouring lands by Punic owners followed. A 28-volume work on agriculture written in Punic by Mago, a retired army general (c. 300), was translated into Latin and later into Greek. The original and both translations have been lost; however, some of Mago's text has survived in other Latin works. Olive trees (e.g., grafting), fruit trees (pomegranate, almond, fig, date palm), viniculture, bees, cattle, sheep, poultry, implements, and farm management were among the ancient topics which Mago discussed. As well, Mago addresses the wine-maker's art (here a type of sherry).\nIn Punic farming society, according to Mago, the small estate owners were the chief producers. They were, two modern historians write, not absent landlords. Rather, the likely reader of Mago was \"the master of a relatively modest estate, from which, by great personal exertion, he extracted the maximum yield.\" Mago counselled the rural landowner, for the sake of their own 'utilitarian' interests, to treat carefully and well their managers and farm workers, or their overseers and slaves. Yet elsewhere these writers suggest that rural land ownership provided also a new power base among the city's nobility, for those resident in their country villas. By many, farming was viewed as an alternative endeavour to an urban business. Another modern historian opines that more often it was the urban merchant of Carthage who owned rural farming land to some profit, and also to retire there during the heat of summer. It may seem that Mago anticipated such an opinion, and instead issued this contrary advice (as quoted by the Roman writer Columella):\n\nThe man who acquires an estate must sell his house, lest he prefer to live in the town rather than in the country. Anyone who prefers to live in a town has no need of an estate in the country.\" \"One who has bought land should sell his town house, so that he will have no desire to worship the household gods of the city rather than those of the country; the man who takes greater delight in his city residence will have no need of a country estate.\nThe issues involved in rural land management also reveal underlying features of Punic society, its structure and stratification. The hired workers might be considered 'rural proletariat', drawn from the local Berbers. Whether there remained Berber landowners next to Punic-run farms is unclear. Some Berbers became sharecroppers. Slaves acquired for farm work were often prisoners of war. In lands outside Punic political control, independent Berbers cultivated grain and raised horses on their lands. Yet within the Punic domain that surrounded the city-state of Carthage, there were ethnic divisions in addition to the usual quasi feudal distinctions between lord and peasant, or master and serf. This inherent instability in the countryside drew the unwanted attention of potential invaders. Yet for long periods Carthage was able to manage these social difficulties.\nThe many amphorae with Punic markings subsequently found about ancient Mediterranean coastal settlements testify to Carthaginian trade in locally made olive oil and wine. Carthage's agricultural production was held in high regard by the ancients, and rivaled that of Rome – they were once competitors, e.g., over their olive harvests. Under Roman rule, however, grain production (wheat and barley) for export increased dramatically in 'Africa'; yet these later fell with the rise in Roman Egypt's grain exports. Thereafter olive groves and vineyards were re-established around Carthage. Visitors to the several growing regions that surrounded the city wrote admiringly of the lush green gardens, orchards, fields, irrigation channels, hedgerows (as boundaries), as well as the many prosperous farming towns located across the rural landscape.\nAccordingly, the Greek author and compiler Diodorus Siculus (fl. 1st century BC), who enjoyed access to ancient writings later lost, and on which he based most of his writings, described agricultural land near the city of Carthage c. 310 BC:\n\nIt was divided into market gardens and orchards of all sorts of fruit trees, with many streams of water flowing in channels irrigating every part. There were country homes everywhere, lavishly built and covered with stucco. ... Part of the land was planted with vines, part with olives and other productive trees. Beyond these, cattle and sheep were pastured on the plains, and there were meadows with grazing horses.\n\nAncient history\nGreek cities contested with Carthage for the Western Mediterranean culminating in the Sicilian Wars and the Pyrrhic War over Sicily, while the Romans fought three wars against Carthage, known as the Punic Wars, from the Latin \"Punicus\" meaning \"Phoenician\", as Carthage was a Phoenician colony grown into an empire.\n\nPunic Republic\nThe Carthaginian republic was one of the longest-lived and largest states in the ancient Mediterranean. Reports relay several wars with Syracuse and finally, Rome, which eventually resulted in the defeat and destruction of Carthage in the Third Punic War. The Carthaginians were Phoenician settlers of primarily Southern Mediterranean and Southern European ancestry. Phoenicians had originated in the Mediterranean coast of the Levant. They spoke Canaanite, a Semitic language, and followed a local variety of the ancient Canaanite religion, the Punic religion. The Carthaginians travelled widely across the seas and set up numerous colonies. Unlike Greek, Phoenician, and Tyrian colonizers who \"only required colonies to pay due respect for their home-cities\", Carthage is said to have \"sent its own magistrates to govern overseas settlements\".\n\nThe fall of Carthage came at the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BC at the Battle of Carthage. Despite initial devastating Roman naval losses and Hannibal's 15-year occupation of much of Roman Italy, who was on the brink of defeat but managed to recover, the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by Scipio Aemilianus. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing and enslaving the people. About 50,000 Carthaginians were sold into slavery. The city was set ablaze and razed to the ground, leaving only ruins and rubble. After the fall of Carthage, Rome annexed the majority of the Carthaginian colonies, including other North African locations such as Volubilis, Lixus, and Chellah. Today a \"Carthaginian peace\" can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.\n\nSalting legend\nSince at least 1863, it has been claimed that Carthage was sown with salt after being razed, but there is no evidence for this.\n\nRoman Carthage\nWhen Carthage fell, its nearby rival Utica, a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the outlet of the Medjerda River, Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of silt to erode into the river. This silt accumulated in the harbor until it became useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.\nBy 122 BC, Gaius Gracchus founded a short-lived colony, called Colonia Iunonia, after the Latin name for the Punic goddess Tanit, Iuno Caelestis. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The Senate abolished the colony some time later, to undermine Gracchus' power.\nAfter this ill-fated effort, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by Julius Caesar in the period from 49 to 44 BC, and by the first century, it had grown to be the second-largest city in the western half of the Roman Empire, with a peak population of 500,000. It was the center of the province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the Empire. Among its major monuments was an amphitheater.\nCarthage also became a center of early Christianity (see Carthage (episcopal see)). In the first of a string of rather poorly reported councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was increasingly represented in the West by the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the Donatist controversy, against which Augustine of Hippo spent much time and parchment arguing. At the Council of Carthage (397), the biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed. The Christians at Carthage conducted persecutions against the pagans, during which the pagan temples, notably the famous Temple of Juno Caelesti, were destroyed.\n\nThe Vandals under Gaiseric invaded Africa in 429. They relinquished the facade of their allied status to Rome and defeated the Roman general Bonifacius to seize Carthage, the once most treasured province of Rome. The 5th-century Roman bishop Victor Vitensis mentions in his Historia Persecutionis Africanae Provincia that the Vandals destroyed parts of Carthage, including various buildings and churches. Once the Vandals were in power, the ecclesiastical authorities were persecuted, the locals were aggressively taxed, and naval raids were routinely launched on Romans in the Mediterranean.\nAfter a failed attempt to recapture the city in the fifth century, the Eastern Roman Empire finally subdued the Vandals in the Vandalic War in 533–534 and made Carthage capital of Byzantine North Africa. Thereafter, the city became the seat of the praetorian prefecture of Africa, which was made into an exarchate during the emperor Maurice's reign, as was Ravenna on the Italian Peninsula. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of the Byzantine Empire, all that remained of its power in the West. In the early seventh century Heraclius the Elder, the exarch of Carthage, overthrew the Byzantine emperor Phocas, whereupon his son Heraclius succeeded to the imperial throne.\n\nIslamic period\nThe Roman Exarchate of Africa was not able to withstand the seventh-century Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The Umayyad Caliphate under Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 686 sent a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qays, who won a battle over the Romans and Berbers led by King Kusaila of the Kingdom of Altava on the plain of Kairouan, but he could not follow that up. In 695, Hassan ibn al-Nu'man captured Carthage and advanced into the Atlas Mountains. An imperial fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698, Hasan ibn al-Nu'man returned and defeated Emperor Tiberios III at the 698 Battle of Carthage. Roman imperial forces withdrew from all of Africa except Ceuta. Fearing that the Byzantine Empire might reconquer it, they decided to destroy Roman Carthage in a scorched earth policy and establish their headquarters somewhere else. Its walls were torn down, the water supply from its aqueducts cut off, the agricultural land was ravaged and its harbors made unusable.\nThe destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to the Byzantine Empire's influence in the region.\nIt is clear from archaeological evidence that the town of Carthage continued to be occupied, as did the neighborhood of Bjordi Djedid. The Baths of Antoninus continued to function in the Arab period and the eleventh-century historian Al-Bakri stated that they were still in good condition at that time. They also had production centers nearby. It is difficult to determine whether the continued habitation of some other buildings belonged to Late Byzantine or Early Arab period. The Bir Ftouha church may have continued to remain in use although it is not clear when it became uninhabited. Constantine the African was born in Carthage.\nThe Medina of Tunis, originally a Berber settlement, was established as the new regional center under the Umayyad Caliphate in the early 8th century. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city profited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909, when the Shi'ite Berbers took over Ifriqiya and founded the Fatimid Caliphate.\nCarthage remained a residential see until the high medieval period, and is mentioned in two letters of Pope Leo IX dated 1053, written in reply to consultations regarding a conflict between the bishops of Carthage and Gummi. In each of the two letters, Pope Leo declares that, after the Bishop of Rome, the first archbishop and chief metropolitan of the whole of Africa is the bishop of Carthage. Later, an archbishop of Carthage named Cyriacus was imprisoned by the Arab rulers because of an accusation by some Christians. Pope Gregory VII wrote Cyriacus a letter of consolation, repeating the hopeful assurances of the primacy of the Church of Carthage, \"whether the Church of Carthage should still lie desolate or rise again in glory\". By 1076, Cyriacus was set free, but there was only one other bishop in the province. These are the last of whom there is mention in that period of the history of the see.\nThe fortress of Carthage was used by the Muslims until Hafsid era and was captured by the Crusaders during the Eighth Crusade. The inhabitants of Carthage were slaughtered by the Crusaders after they took it, and it was used as a base of operations against the Hafsids. After repelling them, Muhammad I al-Mustansir decided to raze Cathage's defenses in order to prevent a repeat.\n\nModern history\nCarthage is some 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) east-northeast of Tunis; the settlements nearest to Carthage were the town of Sidi Bou Said to the north and the village of Le Kram to the south. Sidi Bou Said was a village which had grown around the tomb of the eponymous sufi saint (d. 1231), which had been developed into a town under Ottoman rule in the 18th century. Le Kram was developed in the late 19th century under French administration as a settlement close to the port of La Goulette.\nIn 1881, Tunisia became a French protectorate, and in the same year Charles Lavigerie, who was archbishop of Algiers, became apostolic administrator of the vicariate of Tunis. In the following year, Lavigerie became a cardinal. He \"saw himself as the reviver of the ancient Christian Church of Africa, the Church of Cyprian of Carthage\", and, on 10 November 1884, was successful in his great ambition of having the metropolitan see of Carthage restored, with himself as its first archbishop. In line with the declaration of Pope Leo IX in 1053, Pope Leo XIII acknowledged the revived Archdiocese of Carthage as the primatial see of Africa and Lavigerie as primate.\nThe Acropolium of Carthage (Saint Louis Cathedral of Carthage) was erected on Byrsa hill in 1884.\n\nArchaeological sites\nThe Danish consul Christian Tuxen Falbe conducted a first survey of the topography of the archaeological site (published in 1833).\nAntiquarian interest was intensified following the publication of Flaubert's Salammbô in 1858. Charles Ernest Beulé performed some preliminary excavations of Roman remains on Byrsa hill in 1860. In 1866, Muhammad Khaznadar, the son of the Prime Minister of Tunisia, carried out the first locally led excavations. A more systematic survey of both Punic and Roman-era remains is due to Alfred Louis Delattre, who was sent to Tunis by cardinal Charles Lavigerie in 1875 on both an apostolic and an archaeological mission.\nAudollent cites Delattre and Lavigerie to the effect that in the 1880s, locals still knew the area of the ancient city under the name of Cartagenna (i.e. reflecting the Latin n-stem Carthāgine).\nAuguste Audollent divided the area of Roman Carthage into four quarters, Cartagenna, Dermèche, Byrsa and La Malga. Cartagenna and Dermèche correspond with the lower city, including the site of Punic Carthage; Byrsa is associated with the upper city, which in Punic times was a walled citadel above the harbour; and La Malga is linked with the more remote parts of the upper city in Roman times.\nFrench-led excavations at Carthage began in 1921, and from 1923 reported finds of a large quantity of urns containing a mixture of animal and children's bones. René Dussaud identified a 4th-century BC stela found in Carthage as depicting a child sacrifice.\nA temple at Amman (1400–1250 BC) excavated and reported upon by J.B. Hennessy in 1966, shows the possibility of bestial and human sacrifice by fire. While evidence of child sacrifice in Canaan was the object of academic disagreement, with some scholars arguing that merely children's cemeteries had been unearthed in Carthage, the mixture of children's with animal bones as well as associated epigraphic evidence involving mention of mlk led some to believe that, at least in Carthage, child sacrifice was indeed common practice. However, though the animals were surely sacrificed, this does not entirely indicate that the infants were, and in fact the bones indicate the opposite. Rather, the animal sacrifice was likely done to, in some way, honour the deceased.\nA study conducted in 1970 by M. Chabeuf, the then Doctor of Science from the University of Paris, showed little difference between 17 modern Tunisians, and 68 Punic remains. An analysis the following year on 42 North-West African skulls dating back to Roman times concluded that they were overall similar to modern Berbers and other Mediterranean populations, especially eastern Iberians. They also noted the presence of one outlier in Tunisia who appears to have inherited mechtoid traits, which led them to hypothesize the persistence of such affinities well into the Punic and Roman era.\nM. C. Chamla and D Ferembach (1988) in their entry dealing with the craniometric conclusions of Protohistorical Algerians and Punics in the region of Tunisia, found strong sexual dimorphism with male skulls being robust. Mediterranean elements were dominant, but Mechtoid features, as well as 'Negroid' traits were present in some of the samples. Overall, Punic burials showed affinities with Algerians, Roman Era skulls from Tarragona (Spain), Guanches, and to a lesser extent Abydos (XVIIIth dynasty), Etruscans, Bronze Age Syrians (Euphrates) and skulls from Lozere (France). The anthropological position of the Algerian and Punic people when it comes to populations of the Mediterranean Basin agreed quite well with the geographical situation.\nJehan Desanges stated that \"In the Punic burial grounds, negroid remains were not rare and there were black auxiliaries in the Carthaginian army who were certainly not Nilotics\".\nIn 1990, Shomarka Keita, a biological anthropologist, had conducted a craniometric study which featured a set of remains from Northern Africa. He examined a sample of 49 Maghreban crania which included skulls from pre-Roman Carthage and concluded that, although they were heterogeneous, many of them showed physical similarities to crania from equatorial Africa, ancient Egypt, and Kush; with most having traits conforming to the northern (Lower) Egyptian pattern. S.O.Y. Keita's later report in 2018, found the pre-Roman Carthaginian series to be intermediate between the Phoenician and Maghreban. He noted the findings are consistent with an interpretation that it reflects both local and Levantine ancestry due to specific interactions in the ancient period.\nJoel. D. Irish, when measuring for dental affinities in 2001, found strong similarities and very small distances between the Canary Islanders and Punic Carthaginians (who originated in West Asia), suggesting a particularly close affinity, despite the geographic distance between these two populations. This result according to Irish, may reflect Berber/Carthaginian admixture. Overall, the findings discovered that \"the Canary Island sample is most similar to the four samples from Northwest Africa: the Shawia Berbers, Kabyle Berbers, Bedouin Arabs and Carthaginians, less similar to the three Egyptian samples and least like the three Nubian samples.\"\nIn 2016, an ancient Carthaginian individual, who was excavated from a Punic tomb in Byrsa Hill, was found to belong to the rare U5b2c1 maternal haplogroup. The Young Man of Byrsa specimen dates from the late 6th century BC, and his lineage is believed to represent early gene flow from Iberia to the Maghreb. Craniometric analysis of the young man indicated likely Mediterranean/European ancestry as opposed to African or Asian.\n\nClimate change\nDue to its coastal location, Carthage Archeological Site is vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included it in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C (7.2 °F), and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2,000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2,100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Carthage Archeological Site is threatened by rising water levels, unless it can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.\n\nCommune\nThe commune of Carthage was created by a decree of the Bey of Tunis on 15 June 1919, during the rule of Naceur Bey.\nIn 1920, the first seaplane base was built on the Lake of Tunis for the seaplanes of Compagnie Aéronavale. The Tunis Airfield opened in 1938, serving around 5,800 passengers annually on the Paris-Tunis route.\nDuring World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force as a headquarters and command control base for the Italian Campaign of 1943.\nConstruction on the Tunis-Carthage Airport, which was fully funded by France, began in 1944, and in 1948 the airport become the main hub for Tunisair.\nIn the 1950s the Lycée Français de Carthage was established to serve French families in Carthage. In 1961 it was given to the Tunisian government as part of the Independence of Tunisia, so the nearby Collège Maurice Cailloux in La Marsa, previously an annex of the Lycée Français de Carthage, was renamed to the Lycée Français de La Marsa and began serving the lycée level. It is currently the Lycée Gustave Flaubert.\nAfter Tunisian independence in 1956, the Tunis conurbation gradually extended around the airport, and Carthage (قرطاج Qarṭāj) is now a suburb of Tunis, covering the area between Sidi Bou Said and Le Kram. Its population as of January 2013 was estimated at 21,276,\nmostly attracting the more wealthy residents. If Carthage is not the capital, it tends to be the political pole, a \"place of emblematic power\" according to Sophie Bessis, leaving to Tunis the economic and administrative roles. The Carthage Palace (the Tunisian presidential palace) is located in the coast.\nThe suburb has six train stations of the TGM line between Le Kram and Sidi Bou Said:\nCarthage Salammbo (named for the ancient children's cemetery where it stands), Carthage Byrsa (named for Byrsa hill), Carthage Dermech (Dermèche), Carthage Hannibal (named for Hannibal), Carthage Présidence (named for the Presidential Palace) and Carthage Amilcar (named for Hamilcar).\n\nTrade and business\nThe merchants of Carthage were in part heirs of the Mediterranean trade developed by Phoenicia, and so also heirs of the rivalry with Greek merchants. Business activity was accordingly both stimulated and challenged. Cyprus had been an early site of such commercial contests. The Phoenicians then had ventured into the western Mediterranean, founding trading posts, including Utica and Carthage. The Greeks followed, entering the western seas where the commercial rivalry continued. Eventually it would lead, especially in Sicily, to several centuries of intermittent war. Although Greek-made merchandise was generally considered superior in design, Carthage also produced trade goods in abundance. That Carthage came to function as a manufacturing colossus was shown during the Third Punic War with Rome. Carthage, which had previously disarmed, then was made to face the fatal Roman siege. The city \"suddenly organised the manufacture of arms\" with great skill and effectiveness. According to Strabo (63 BC – AD 21) in his Geographica:\n\n[Carthage] each day produced one hundred and forty finished shields, three hundred swords, five hundred spears, and one thousand missiles for the catapults... . Furthermore, [Carthage although surrounded by the Romans] built one hundred and twenty decked ships in two months... for old timber had been stored away in readiness, and a large number of skilled workmen, maintained at public expense.\nThe textile industry in Carthage probably started in private homes, but the existence of professional weavers indicates that a sort of factory system later developed. Products included embroidery, carpets, and use of the purple murex dye (for which the Carthaginian isle of Djerba was famous). Metalworkers developed specialized skills, i.e., making various weapons for the armed forces, as well as domestic articles, such as knives, forks, scissors, mirrors, and razors (all articles found in tombs). Artwork in metals included vases and lamps in bronze, also bowls, and plates. Other products came from such crafts as the potters, the glassmakers, and the goldsmiths. Inscriptions on votive stele indicate that many were not slaves but 'free citizens'.\n\nPhoenician and Punic merchant ventures were often run as a family enterprise, putting to work its members and its subordinate clients. Such family-run businesses might perform a variety of tasks: own and maintain the ships, providing the captain and crew; do the negotiations overseas, either by barter or buying and selling, of their own manufactured commodities and trade goods, and native products (metals, foodstuffs, etc.) to carry and trade elsewhere; and send their agents to stay at distant outposts in order to make lasting local contacts, and later to establish a warehouse of shipped goods for exchange, and eventually perhaps a settlement. Over generations, such activity might result in the creation of a wide-ranging network of trading operations. Ancillary would be the growth of reciprocity between different family firms, foreign and domestic.\nState protection was extended to its sea traders by the Phoenician city of Tyre and later likewise by the daughter city-state of Carthage. Stéphane Gsell, the well-regarded French historian of ancient North Africa, summarized the major principles guiding the civic rulers of Carthage with regard to its policies for trade and commerce:\n\nto open and maintain markets for its merchants, whether by entering into direct contact with foreign peoples using either treaty negotiations or naval power, or by providing security for isolated trading stations\nthe reservation of markets exclusively for the merchants of Carthage, or where competition could not be eliminated, to regulate trade by state-sponsored agreements with its commercial rivals\nsuppression of piracy, and promotion of Carthage's ability to freely navigate the seas\nBoth the Phoenicians and the Carthaginians were well known in antiquity for their secrecy in general, and especially pertaining to commercial contacts and trade routes. Both cultures excelled in commercial dealings. Strabo (63 BC – AD 21), the Greek geographer, wrote that before its fall (in 146 BC) Carthage enjoyed a population of 700,000 and directed an alliance of 300 cities. The Greek historian Polybius (c. 203–120) referred to Carthage as \"the wealthiest city in the world\".\n\nConstitution of state\nA \"suffet\" (possibly two) was elected by the citizens, and held office with no military power for a one-year term. Carthaginian generals marshalled mercenary armies and were separately elected. From about 550 to 450 the Magonid family monopolized the top military position; later the Barcid family acted similarly. Eventually it came to be that, after a war, the commanding general had to testify justifying his actions before a court of 104 judges.\nAristotle (384–322) discusses Carthage in his work, Politica; he begins: \"The Carthaginians are also considered to have an excellent form of government.\" He briefly describes the city as a \"mixed constitution\", a political arrangement with cohabiting elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, i.e., a king (Gk: basileus), a council of elders (Gk: gerusia), and the people (Gk: demos). Later Polybius of Megalopolis (c. 204–122, Greek) in his Histories would describe the Roman Republic in more detail as a mixed constitution in which the Consuls were the monarchy, the Senate the aristocracy, and the Assemblies the democracy.\nEvidently Carthage also had an institution of elders who advised the Suffets, similar to a Greek gerusia or the Roman Senate. We do not have a Punic name for this body. At times its members would travel with an army general on campaign. Members also formed permanent committees. The institution had several hundred members drawn from the wealthiest class who held office for life. Vacancies were probably filled by recruitment from among the elite, i.e., by co-option. From among its members were selected the 104 Judges mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to evaluate not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the ephorate of Sparta with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life. At some stage there also came to be independent self-perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.\nPopular assemblies also existed at Carthage. When deadlocked the Suffets and the quasi-senatorial institution of elders might request the assembly to vote; also, assembly votes were requested in very crucial matters in order to achieve political consensus and popular coherence. The assembly members had no legal wealth or birth qualification. How its members were selected is unknown, e.g., whether by festival group or urban ward or another method.\nThe Greeks were favourably impressed by the constitution of Carthage; Aristotle had a separate study of it made, which is lost. In his Politica he states: \"The government of Carthage is oligarchical, but they successfully escape the evils of oligarchy by enriching one portion of the people after another by sending them to their colonies.\" \"[T]heir policy is to send some [poorer citizens] to their dependent towns, where they grow rich.\" Yet Aristotle continues, \"[I]f any misfortune occurred, and the bulk of the subjects revolted, there would be no way of restoring peace by legal means.\" Aristotle remarked also:\n\nMany of the Carthaginian institutions are excellent. The superiority of their constitution is proved by the fact that the common people remain loyal to the constitution; the Carthaginians have never had any rebellion worth speaking of, and have never been under the rule of a tyrant.\nThe city-state of Carthage, whose citizens were mainly Libyphoenicians (of Phoenician ancestry born in Africa), dominated and exploited an agricultural countryside composed mainly of native Berber sharecroppers and farmworkers, whose affiliations to Carthage were open to divergent possibilities. Beyond these more settled Berbers and the Punic farming towns and rural manors, lived the independent Berber tribes, who were mostly pastoralists.\nIn the brief, uneven review of government at Carthage found in his Politica Aristotle mentions several faults. Thus, \"that the same person should hold many offices, which is a favorite practice among the Carthaginians.\" Aristotle disapproves, mentioning the flute-player and the shoemaker. Also, that \"magistrates should be chosen not only for their merit but for their wealth.\" Aristotle's opinion is that focus on pursuit of wealth will lead to oligarchy and its evils.\n\n[S]urely it is a bad thing that the greatest offices... should be bought. The law which allows this abuse makes wealth of more account than virtue, and the whole state becomes avaricious. For, whenever the chiefs of the state deem anything honorable, the other citizens are sure to follow their example; and, where virtue has not the first place, their aristocracy cannot be firmly established.\nIn Carthage the people seemed politically satisfied and submissive, according to the historian Warmington. They in their assemblies only rarely exercised the few opportunities given them to assent to state decisions. Popular influence over government appears not to have been an issue at Carthage. Being a commercial republic fielding a mercenary army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which can foster the feel for popular political action. But perhaps this misunderstands the society; perhaps the people, whose values were based on small-group loyalty, felt themselves sufficiently connected to their city's leadership by the very integrity of the person-to-person linkage within their social fabric. Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for tyrants. Only after defeat by Rome devastated Punic imperial ambitions did the people of Carthage seem to question their governance and to show interest in political reform.\nIn 196, following the Second Punic War (218–201), Hannibal, still greatly admired as a Barcid military leader, was elected suffet. When his reforms were blocked by a financial official about to become a judge for life, Hannibal rallied the populace against the 104 judges. He proposed a one-year term for the 104, as part of a major civic overhaul. Additionally, the reform included a restructuring of the city's revenues, and the fostering of trade and agriculture. The changes rather quickly resulted in a noticeable increase in prosperity. Yet his incorrigible political opponents cravenly went to Rome, to charge Hannibal with conspiracy, namely, plotting war against Rome in league with Antiochus the Hellenic ruler of Syria. Although the Roman Scipio Africanus resisted such manoeuvre, eventually intervention by Rome forced Hannibal to leave Carthage. Thus, corrupt city officials efficiently blocked Hannibal in his efforts to reform the government of Carthage.\nMago (6th century) was King of Carthage; the head of state, war leader, and religious figurehead. His family was considered to possess a sacred quality. Mago's office was somewhat similar to that of a pharaoh, but although kept in a family it was not hereditary, it was limited by legal consent. Picard, accordingly, believes that the council of elders and the popular assembly are late institutions. Carthage was founded by the king of Tyre who had a royal monopoly on this trading venture. Thus it was the royal authority stemming from this traditional source of power that the King of Carthage possessed. Later, as other Phoenician ship companies entered the trading region, and so associated with the city-state, the King of Carthage had to keep order among a rich variety of powerful merchants in their negotiations among themselves and over risky commerce across the Mediterranean. Under these circumstance, the office of king began to be transformed. Yet it was not until the aristocrats of Carthage became wealthy owners of agricultural lands in Africa that a council of elders was institutionalized at Carthage.\n\nContemporary sources\nMost ancient literature concerning Carthage comes from Greek and Roman sources as Carthage's own documents were destroyed by the Romans. Apart from inscriptions, hardly any Punic literature has survived, and none in its own language and script. A brief catalogue would include:\n\nthree short treaties with Rome (Latin translations);\nseveral pages of Hanno the Navigator's log-book concerning his fifth century maritime exploration of the Atlantic coast of west Africa (Greek translation);\nfragments quoted from Mago's fourth/third century 28-volume treatise on agriculture (Latin translations);\nthe Roman playwright Plautus (c. 250 – 184) in his Poenulus incorporates a few fictional speeches delivered in Punic, whose written lines are transcribed into Latin letters phonetically;\nthe thousands of inscriptions made in Punic script, thousands, but many extremely short, e.g., a dedication to a deity with the personal name(s) of the devotee(s).\n\"[F]rom the Greek author Plutarch [(c. 46 – c. 120)] we learn of the 'sacred books' in Punic safeguarded by the city's temples. Few Punic texts survive, however.\" Once \"the City Archives, the Annals, and the scribal lists of Suffets\" existed, but evidently these were destroyed in the horrific fires during the Roman capture of the city in 146 BC.\nYet some Punic books (Latin: libri punici) from the libraries of Carthage reportedly did survive the fires. These works were apparently given by Roman authorities to the newly augmented Berber rulers. Over a century after the fall of Carthage, the Roman politician-turned-author Gaius Sallustius Crispus or Sallust (86–34) reported his having seen volumes written in Punic, which books were said to be once possessed by the Berber king, Hiempsal II (r. 88–81). By way of Berber informants and Punic translators, Sallust had used these surviving books to write his brief sketch of Berber affairs.\n\nProbably some of Hiempsal II's libri punici, that had escaped the fires that consumed Carthage in 146 BC, wound up later in the large royal library of his grandson Juba II (r. 25 BC–AD 24). Juba II not only was a Berber king, and husband of Cleopatra's daughter, but also a scholar and author in Greek of no less than nine works. He wrote for the Mediterranean-wide audience then enjoying classical literature. The libri punici inherited from his grandfather surely became useful to him when composing his Libyka, a work on North Africa written in Greek. Only fragments of Libyka survive, mostly from quotations made by other ancient authors. It may have been Juba II who 'discovered' the five-centuries-old 'log book' of Hanno the Navigator, called the Periplus, among library documents saved from fallen Carthage.\nIn the end, however, most Punic writings that survived the destruction of Carthage \"did not escape the immense wreckage in which so many of Antiquity's literary works perished.\" Accordingly, the long and continuous interactions between Punic citizens of Carthage and the Berber communities that surrounded the city have no local historian. Their political arrangements and periodic crises, their economic and work life, the cultural ties and social relations established and nourished (infrequently as kin), are not known to us directly from ancient Punic authors in written accounts. Neither side has left us their stories about life in Punic-era Carthage.\nRegarding Phoenician writings, few remain and these seldom refer to Carthage. The more ancient and most informative are cuneiform tablets, c. 1600–1185, from ancient Ugarit, located to the north of Phoenicia on the Syrian coast; it was a Canaanite city politically affiliated with the Hittites. The clay tablets tell of myths, epics, rituals, medical and administrative matters, and also correspondence. The highly valued works of Sanchuniathon, an ancient priest of Beirut, who reportedly wrote on Phoenician religion and the origins of civilization, are themselves completely lost, but some little content endures twice removed. Sanchuniathon was said to have lived in the 11th century, which is considered doubtful. Much later a Phoenician History by Philo of Byblos (64–141) reportedly existed, written in Greek, but only fragments of this work survive. An explanation proffered for why so few Phoenician works endured: early on (11th century) archives and records began to be kept on papyrus, which does not long survive in a moist coastal climate. Also, both Phoenicians and Carthaginians were well known for their secrecy.\nThus, of their ancient writings we have little of major interest left to us by Carthage, or by Phoenicia the country of origin of the city founders. \"Of the various Phoenician and Punic compositions alluded to by the ancient classical authors, not a single work or even fragment has survived in its original idiom.\" \"Indeed, not a single Phoenician manuscript has survived in the original [language] or in translation.\" We cannot therefore access directly the line of thought or the contour of their worldview as expressed in their own words, in their own voice. Ironically, it was the Phoenicians who \"invented or at least perfected and transmitted a form of writing [the alphabet] that has influenced dozens of cultures including our own.\"\nAs noted, the celebrated ancient books on agriculture written by Mago of Carthage survives only via quotations in Latin from several later Roman works.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Carthage\nCarthage tophet\nAsterius Chapel\nMosaic of the Horses of Carthage\nNecropolis of the Rabs\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAltekamp, Stefan (2024).

      "summary": "Carthage (Arabic: قرطاج, ) was an ancient city in Northern Africa, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now Tunisia. Carthage was one of the most important trading hubs of the Ancient Mediterranean and one of the most affluent cities of the classical world. It became the capital city of the civilization of Ancient Carthage and later Roman Carthage.\nThe city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC. The legendary Queen Elissa, Alyssa or Dido, originally from Tyre, is regarded as the founder of the city, though her historicity has been questioned. In the myth, Dido asked for land from a local tribe, which told her that she could get as much land as an oxhide could cover. She cut the oxhide into strips and laid out the perimeter of the new city. As Carthage prospered at home, the polity sent colonists abroad as well as magistrates to rule the colonies.\nThe ancient city was destroyed in the nearly three year siege of Carthage by the Roman Republic during the Third Punic War in 146 BC. It was re-developed a century later as Roman Carthage, which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa. The question of Carthaginian decline and demise has remained a subject of literary, political, artistic, and philosophical debates in both ancient and modern histories.\nLate antique and medieval Carthage continued to play an important cultural and economic role in the Byzantine period. The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire. It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade. The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could not be used as a base by a hostile power again. It also continued to function as an episcopal see.\nThe regional power shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period, until the early 20th century, when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis, incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919. The archaeological site was first surveyed in 1830, by Danish consul Christian Tuxen Falbe. Excavations were performed in the second half of the 19th century by Charles Ernest Beulé and by Alfred Louis Delattre. The Carthage National Museum was founded in 1875 by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie. Excavations performed by French archaeologists in the 1920s first attracted attention because of the evidence they produced for child sacrifice. There has been considerable disagreement among scholars concerning whether child sacrifice was practiced by ancient Carthage. The open-air Carthage Paleo-Christian Museum has exhibits excavated under the auspices of UNESCO from 1975 to 1984. The site of the ruins is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

المدينة        «قَرْت حَدَشْت» بمعنى «المدينة الجديدة» (من الفينيقية: قَرْت أي مدينة أو قرية، وحَدَشْت أي حديثة)، فأصبح الاسم «قرطاج» عن طريق النطق اللاتيني. وكانوا يعبدون خاصة «ملقرت»، واسمه يعني «ملك المدينة».\n\nالتاريخ\nقرطاج البونية (الفينيقية)\nتأسيس قرطاج 814 ق م: حقيقة|هربت عليسة أميرة صور المعروفة باسم الملكة ديدون من قهر أخيها بيقماليون ملك فينيقيا، وقامت برحلة طويلة حول حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط بحثا عن موقع متميّز يمكّنها من تأسيس مدينة جديدة «قرط حدشت».\nمن القرن 7 ق.م. إلى القرن 4 ق.م: بسطت قرطاج إمبراطوريتها وأسّست مستعمرات فينيقيّة جديدة، إمتدّت من غرب البحر الأبيض المتوسط إلى حدود السواحل الأطلسيّـة لوسط أفريقيا.\nمن 264 ق.م إلى 146 ق.م: عاشت قرطاج في هذه المدّة ثلاث حروب عظيمة ضد روما سُمّيت بالحروب البونيقية والتي دارت بين قرطاج وروما وشهدت حملة عسكرية قام بها القائد العظيم حنبعل الذي قطع جبال الألب بواسطة أفياله من سنة 218 ق.م إلى سنة 202 ق.م. وانتهت هذه الحروب بهزيمة قرطاج وسقوطها.\nالحرب البونيّة الأولى: 264 ق.م-241 ق.م: عند إنتصار الأسطول الروماني في 241 ق.م. طلبت قرطاج الصلح وفقدت صقلية.\nالحرب البونية الثانية: 219 ق.م-201 ق.م: بعد إنتصاراته المجدية ضد الرومان هزم القائد القرطاجني حنبعل سنة 202 ق.م في معركة زاما.\nالحرب البونية الثالثة: 149 ق.م-146 ق.م: سنة 146 ق.م دُمِّرت قرطاج كُليا من قبل سيبيون الإميلي.\n\nقرطاج الرومانية\nلمّا ألحقت قرطاج بالإمبراطورية الرومانية، أعيد بناؤها في عهد أغسطس (إمبراطور) في أواخر القرن الأوّل ق.م، فزوّدت بما تمتاز به مدينة رومانيّة كبيرة من بنى تحتيّة حضريّة وبنايات عموميّة دينيّة ومدنيّة ومساكن فخمة. وغدت قرطاج عاصمة إداريّة وثقافيّة وفنّية لمقاطعة أفريكا، فعاشت فترة من الازدهار الكبير وبلغت درجة عالية من الترف وشهدت حركة إبداعيّة ثقافيّة وفنيّة قويّة، قبل أن يصيبها التقهقر الذي أصاب الإمبراطورية الرومانية عند أفول نجمها سنة 235 م وتعرّضت للإضطرابات وعمت الفوضى قرطاج.\n\nقرطاج المسيحية\nعرفت قرطاج في حكم قسطنطين الأول سنة 312 م فترة من الرفاهة والثروة وانتشار الدين المسيحي حيث سيطرت المسيحية تماما على كل شمال أفريقيا.\n\nقرطاج الوندالية 439-534 م\nرغم مقاومة هجمات الوندال التي دامت قرابة الثماني سنوات

رفاهية حقيقية ونهضة جديدة.\n\nقرطاج الإسلامية\nيمثل عام 670 م بداية الفتح الإسلامي، فقد أرسل الخليفة الأموي حسان بن النعمان على الجيش الذي دخل إفريقية مع عقبة بن نافع، ورغم انتصاراته في الجنوب التونسي، اصطدم عقبة بن نافع بمقاومة شديدة من رومانيه مع السكان الاصليين البربر وقد تغلّبوا عليه فيما بعد في منطقة تهودة بالجزائر، لكن قتل فيما بعد ليواجه الكاهنة ديهيا. وفي سنة 698 م تمكن حسان بن النعمان من الانتصار على كل التحالف البيزنطي والبربري ومنذ الفتح الإسلامي فقدت قرطاج مركزها كعاصمة وعوضتها تباعا القيروان فالمهدية وأخيرا تونس.\n\nقرطاج المعاصرة\nحاولت المسيحية خلال منتصف القرن التاسع عشر استعادة مجدها الديني في قرطاج حيث قام الكاردينال لافيجري سنة 1857م ببناء الكنيسة «كاتيدرال سان لويس» وعندما بسطت الحماية الفرنسية نفوذها على تونس قامت الكنيسة الكاثوليكية بإحياء إبريشية القديس سيبريان (كان أسقف قرطاج منذ عام 249 م وأبًا وكاتبًا مسيحيًا).\nأصبحت قرطاج منذ بداية القرن العشرين مقرا لإقامة الأمين باي آخر بايات تونس.\nوفي هذا المكان أعلن رئيس الحكومة الفرنسي مانداس فرانس عن

الشمالي المطل على منتصف الساحل الجنوبي لحوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط حين رست سفينة الأميرة الفينيقية إيليسا ديدون على ضفاف الهضبة حاملةً الأميرة الفينيقية القادمة من عام 814 ق. م أي منذ 2825 عاماً مضت. وقد دخلت السفينة ورست على الشاطئ الإفريقي في وضح النهار ودخل معها نور التاريخ والحضارة. ثم لحق بالأميرة أمير سوري فينيقي يدعى عينة بعد حريق مدينة طروادة، وهناك عشق الأميرة الفينيقية إيليسا Elissa من مدينة صور التي أسست مدينة قرطاج في القرن التاسع ق. م، ولظروفٍ غامضة أجبر على الهرب إلى إيطاليا وأسس هناك العديد من المدن ومنها مدينة لافينيوم Lavinium ومدينة روما.\nوحسب ما جاء في الملحمة الشعرية الإينيد Eneide للشاعر اللاتيني بوبيليوس فيرجيليوس ماروpublius virgilius maro (70-19 ق. م) صديق أوكتاف أن إينيه /عينة Enee الهارب أحبَّ ديدون/ إيليسا وتزوجها، إلا أنه أجبر على هجرها بناءً على أوامر الإله زيوس/ جوبيتير ولهذا قتلته. ويذكر في المعتقدات الدينية الرومانية أيضاً أن روميليوس/ رومولوس Romulus مؤسس مدينة روما من أحفاد عينة وزوجته الفينيقية إيليسا من مدينة قرطاج.\n\nالثقافة\nتحتوي مدينة قرطاج على مكتبة عمومية ومركزا ثقافيا و20 رواقا فنيا وفيها الأكربوليوم وتضم متحفا واحدا متحف قرطاج و20 متنزها عموميا.\n\nمهرجان قرطاج الدولي\nهو مهرجان سنوي للموسيقى، ينتظم في الفترة المتدة من منتصف شهر (يوليو، تموز) إلى منتصف شهر آب من كل سنة منذ سنة 1964 بمدينة قرطاج الساحلية، الواقعة قرب مدينة تونس. يحتضن المسرح الأثري بقرطاج فعاليات هذا المهرجان كل سنة ويعتبر مهرجان قرطاج من أبرز المهرجانات العربية والعالمية واعرقها.\nوكذلك يقام فيها مهرجان أيام قرطاج المسرحية وفعاليات أخرى متعددة.\n\nمتحف قرطاج\nينتصب المتحف على قمة هضبة بيرسا تم إنشاؤه عام 1875 م. وهو من حيث التنظيم المتحفي يحفظ ويعرض مجموعات من التحف الأثرية التي وجدت في هذا الموقع ويمثل ثلاث فترات كبـرى: الفترة الفينيقيـة البونيـة، الفترة الرومانية الإفريقية والفترة العربية الإسلامية.\n\nالمعالم الاثرية الأخرى\nالحي البونيقي والفوروم: يقع هذا الحي بجوار متحف قرطاج الوطني وداخل نطاقه إذ يشكل جناحا تابعا لهذا المتحف يقع في الهواء الطلق. وقد تمت تهيئة هذا الحي في عهد حنبعل (في أوائل القرن الثاني ق م). وهو حي سكني تخترقه شوارع تتقاطع حسب زاوية قائمة، وتقوم داخله مجموعة من المباني ذات الطوابق نجدها مجزأة إلى شقق سكنية على غرار البناء الحديث. كما نجد به دكاكين مفتوحة على الشارع بالطابق الأرضي من المباني.\nدمر حي بيرسا وأحرق مع كامل المدينة في سنة 146 ق م، ولكنه ظل محميا من الاندثار تحت طبقة ضخمة من التراب والأنقاض جنبته الزوال والتسوية بالأرض خلال قرون عدة.\n\nحمامات أنطونيوس: شيدت الحمامات على شاطئ البحر في منتصف القرن الثاني بعد الميلاد (145 م- 162م) ثم دمرها الوندال فبقيت مدة طويلة مغمورة تحت التراب. ولم يتم الكشف عنها وإزاحة التربة من فوقها إلا بعد سنة 1945.\nتأتي هذه الحمامات في المرتبة الثالثة في العالم من حيث الحجم بعد حمامات كاركالا بإيطاليا وحمامات ديوكليسيان بسوريا. ولم يبق منها اليوم سوى الطابق تحت الأرضي الذي كانت به غرف مقببة تمثل القاعات الفخمة للحمامات، وفي المحور الأوسط توجد القاعة الباردة (Frigidaire) مقاييسها 47 × 22 مترا محمولة على ثمانية أعمدة من الغرانيت كبيرة الحجم من ضمنها واحدة تم ترميمها لإعطاء فكرة عن ارتفاعها (15 مترا مع التاج) كما توجد القاعة الساخنة على شكل قبة. ومن الجهتين تمتد، بالتناظر، الأجنحة المكونة من غرف منتصبة بانتظام حول الصحن المكشوف على الساحة.\n\nحي المنازل الرومانية: يحتوي هذا الحي على مجموعة من المنازل الارستقراطية موزعة بتناسق على سفح الهضبة الشرقية للاديون أو المسرح وعلى طول الكاردو و«دوكيمانوس» (نهجان بقرطاج حسب تقسيم الشوارع الرومانية القديمة) وتخترق ممرات وفق رسم الشوارع الرومانية القديمة. ومن بين المعالم التي لا تزال قائمة:\n- مبنى «السكولا» Schola وهو مقر جمعية سياسية دينية، تقام فيه الطقوس الإمبراطورية\n- كنيسة مسيحية تعود إلى القرن السابع\n- كنيسة ذات طابع معماري بيزنطي خالص\n- مقبرة بونيقية\n- منزل روماني يعود تاريخه إلى القرن الثالث تم ترميمه جزئيا في سنة 1960 وأطلق عليه اسم \"villa de la voliére \" فيه رسوم فيفسائية تغطي أرضية البهو.\n\nالأديون: أو المسرح ويتقدم هذا المعلم شمالا بهو في شكل مستطيل قد تهدم كليا ولم يبق منه سوى الأسس وبعض العناصر المعمارية وبعض الزينة التي عثر عليها خلال الحفريات 1900-1901.\nوقد أخرجت من الصهاريج الموجودة في الطابق تحت أرضي مجموعة كبيرة من أجزاء مرمرية وتماثيل وأجزاء معمارية كانت من ضمن زخرفة «الأديون».\nوكان هذا المعلم محل حفريات وبحث ودراسة من سنة 1994 إلى سنة 1999.\n\nمسرح قرطاج الروماني: شيد المسرح الروماني في أوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد على ضفاف هضبة «أوديون» Odeon» «ويتميز هذا المعلم بهندسته وزخرفته وبمدارجه نصف الدائرية التي يفوق قطرها 100 م تتخللها أعمدة متوجة من الرخام المزركش.\nوزين مسرح قرطاج بتماثيل من بينها تمثال أبولون والذي تم إيداعه بمتحف باردو. لعب هذا المسرح دورا هاما جدا في حياة مواطني قرطاج الذين كانوا مولعين بالمسرح والموسيقى وفن المحاكاة والفلسفة مما ساهم في إشعاع الثقافة في تلك الحقبة.\nوقد رمم سنة 1967 ليكون فضاء مهرجان قرطاج الدولي.\n\nكنيسة داموس الكريطة: يضم هذا المركب الديني الشاسع كنيستان وبعض المباني الملحقة بهما. عثر عليه في أفريقية الرومانية (65 م/ 45 م) فإنها تبدو مقسمة إلى أجنحة عديدة بأعمدة لم يبق لها أثر زيادة على جناحين كبيرين يتلاقيان وسط المعلم وينتهي كل منها بصدرفي الجنوب الشرقي والجنوب الغربي.\nصهاريج المعلقة: تتكون من 15 صهريجا طول الواحد 100 متر وعرضه 7 أمتار وارتفاعه 7,50 متر، تحتل كلها أكثر من هكتار من المساحة وتبلغ كمية خزنها أكثر من 50.000 متر مكعب. وقد استعملت هذه الصهاريج في القرون الوسطى من طرف سكان القرى المجاورة.\nالمسرح الدائري بقرطاج: يوجد في مدخل المدينة من جهة الطريق السريعة تونس – قرطاج. كانت ساحة الأنفتياتر شاهدة على كل المعارك الدامية التي وقعت بين المصارعين والمحكومين عليهم بالإعدام والحيوانات المفترسة. وكانت الغاية من هذه المصارعة التي ينظمها الحاكم إبراز للرعية مصير كل خارج عن سياسة حكمه. وقد بني منذ تأسيس المدينة بمساحة حوالي 120 مترا×93 متر، وحلبة تبلغ مساحتها 64 مترا× 36 متر. ووقع توسيعه في القرنين الثاني والثالث إلى أن بلغ مساحته 156م ×128 م وبلغ حجم استيعابه أكثر من 41 ألف نسمة.\nحي ماغون: اكتشف حي ماقون بعد حفريات عدة أجريت على ضفاف البحر. ويمثل هذا الموقع تجمعا سكنيا يعود إلى القرن الخامس ق م ويتميز بتواجد حي حسب تصميم متناسق محمي بسور مزود بكل شيء بمــا في ذلك مرسى بحري.\nوفي الفترة الأخيرة وقع تحوير في الحي حيث وسعت المنازل وأصبحت تضم فناء وأعمدة وطابقا علويا ويوجد بالحي خزانات وآبار تزوده بالماء، كما تدل بقايا الحي المدهون والأرضية المزوقة على قيمة المعمار في تلك الحقبة من التاريخ.\nلقد دمر الحي في قرطاج البونية لكن الرومان أسسوا عاصمة جديـدة على الموقع ذاته وحافظوا على نفس النسق العمراني الذي امتد على كامـــل أرض المدينة.\n\nمدفن \" التوفاة \": كان القرطاجيون يعتقدون في وجود عالم فوقي مليء بالكائنات المقدسة المنظمة، فقاموا ببعض الطقوس التي تضمن للمؤمن الرخاء والسعادة في الأرض وأيضا الخلاص الأبدي للروح ولقد كانوا يعبدون آلهة كثيرة من أصل فينيقي، ملقوت وعشترت وخصوصا بعل حامون إله المطر ورب المياه والنبات ورفيقته تانيت آلاهة الحياة والخصب التي يظهر اسمها على آلاف الآثار القرطاجية.\nالمواني البونية:\nالمعلم الدائري:\n\nالرياضة\nفيها الملعب

      "content": "Carthage  (arabe : قرطاج, Qarṭāj, /qærtˤɑʒ/, ) est une ville tunisienne située au nord-est de la capitale Tunis.\nL'ancienne cité punique, Qart Hadasht, berceau de la civilisation carthaginoise, détruite puis reconstruite par les Romains qui en font la capitale de la province d'Afrique proconsulaire, est aujourd'hui l'une des municipalités les plus huppées du Grand Tunis, résidence officielle du président de la République, regroupant de nombreuses résidences d'ambassadeurs ou de richissimes fortunes tunisiennes et expatriées. La ville possède encore de nombreux sites archéologiques, romains pour la plupart avec quelques éléments puniques, classés au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis le 27 juillet 1979.\nLa municipalité de Carthage, qui compte 17 010 habitants en 2014, abrite le palais présidentiel, la mosquée Mâlik ibn Anas, le musée national de Carthage, l'université de Carthage ou encore l'Académie tunisienne des sciences, des lettres et des arts. L'aéroport international de Tunis-Carthage est situé à quelques kilomètres à l'ouest de la ville.\n\nToponymie\nLe nom de Carthage provient du phénicien Qart-Hadašt ou QRT.HDŠT (prononcé : Qart Hadasht, qui signifie « Nouvelle ville », ce qui pourrait faire penser à « Nouvelle Tyr ». Sous la domination romaine, la ville prend le nom de Carthago (latin : Karthago, /'kar.ta.go/).\nL'ancienne ville de Carthagène en Ibérie (actuelle Espagne) porte aussi le même nom de Qart Hadasht.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville de Carthage se situe dans le Nord-Est de la Tunisie, à environ 15 kilomètres de la capitale Tunis, sur une colline s'élevant à 57 mètres d'altitude et avec un littoral s'étendant sur environ 3 kilomètres. Elle est délimitée à l'Est par la mer Méditerranée (golfe de Tunis), au Nord par Sidi Bou Saïd, à l'Ouest par La Marsa et au Sud par Le Kram.\n\nHistoire\nCivilisation carthaginoise\nCarthage est fondée par la reine Didon de Tyr en 814 av. J.-C.. D'après la légende, ce serait la reine Didon — ou Élyssa —, sœur du roi de Tyr, Pygmalion, qui fonda la cité. La reine aurait demandé au souverain local Hiarbas, un roi libyque, l'autorisation de fonder un royaume sur ses terres. Celui-ci lui offrit alors un terrain aussi grand qu'une peau de vache. La reine plus maligne fait couper une peau de vache en lanières très fines et trace les contours de Carthage. En référence à cette fondatrice mythique, les Carthaginois sont parfois surnommés les « enfants de Didon » dans la littérature.\n\nLa ville devient une puissance dominante en Méditerranée occidentale au IVe siècle av. J.-C. Les Carthaginois pratiquaient un culte polythéiste originaire du Moyen-Orient. Ils vénéraient en particulier Baal et Tanit. Rome les accusa longtemps de sacrifier des enfants (cérémonie du molk), ce qu'il convient de nuancer. Une hypothèse parmi d'autres suggère que le rituel d'incinération avait surtout pour objectif de renvoyer l'âme des enfants défunts par le plus court chemin vers Ba'al Hammon à une époque où la mortalité infantile était plus qu'importante malgré les progrès en matière d'hygiène.\nD'après d'autres sources, le sacrifice d'enfants bien vivants, généralement l'aîné des familles de notables, dans le but de prouver la sincérité de leur dévouement à Carthage, semble avoir initié la coutume de ces derniers d'adopter un enfant d'esclave pour cet usage.\nCe sont les Carthaginois qui introduisent le glaive court en fer dans le bassin méditerranéen, car jusqu'alors, les guerriers s'affrontent à l'aide de lances et de frondes. Carthage conquiert l'Hispanie ainsi que la Sicile où elle se heurte aux Romains.\nLa cité antique de Carthage est au cœur du roman Salammbô, écrit en 1862 par Gustave Flaubert, qui se déroule à l'époque d'Hamilcar Barca, c'est-à-dire lors de la jeunesse d'Hannibal Barca.\n\nCité romaine, vandale et byzantine\nUne série de trois conflits entre les deux puissances, les guerres puniques — les Romains nomment les Carthaginois Poeni —, débutent au IIIe siècle av. J.-C. Malgré de nombreux revers et la puissance maritime et stratégique de Carthage, celle-ci perd les trois guerres consécutivement. Le cycle se termine après un siège de quatre ans avec la victoire de Rome et la destruction de Carthage en 146 av. J.-C. par les Romains dirigés par le général Scipion Émilien, petit-fils de Scipion l'Africain qui avait déjà soumis les Carthaginois en 201 av. J.-C. et allié au roi numide Massinissa (bataille de Zama).\nAprès une tentative avortée des Gracques, Jules César fonde par la suite une cité sur les ruines de la ville punique (Colonia Julia Carthago). Celle-ci devient la capitale de la nouvelle province d'Afrique. Au Bas-Empire, la cité, gagnée au christianisme, subit les persécutions impériales. Carthage devient, au IVe siècle, l'une des plus grandes capitales spirituelles d'Occident.\nElle est conquise en 439 par les Vandales menés par Genséric, qui y fondent un royaume. L'Église est alors victime de persécutions et particulièrement meurtrie. La reprise par les Romains (Empire romain d'Orient) en 533 ramène la prospérité à la capitale d'Afrique.\nL'empereur Justinien Ier en fait le siège de son diocèse d'Afrique, mais à la suite de la crise monothélite, les empereurs de Byzance, opposés à l'Église d'Afrique, se détournent rapidement de Carthage qui devient le siège d'un exarchat. Carthage donne ensuite à Constantinople une lignée d'empereurs à la suite d'Héraclius, fils de l'exarque de Carthage.\nÀ l'époque des conquêtes arabes, ces derniers prennent la ville en 698, mais lui préfèrent Tunis, la cité voisine, qui donne son nom au pays, celui d'Afrique désignant désormais le continent entier. À la suite de ce siège mené par Hassan Ibn Numan, la ville est mise à sac et sa population déplacée vers Tunis. Les matériaux issus de la destruction de Carthage serviront par la suite à l’expansion des infrastructures de la ville voisine.\n\nDu Moyen Âge à l'effacement\nAu Moyen Âge, Saint Louis prend la ville pendant la huitième croisade, au cours de laquelle il meurt de la dysenterie ; il espérait alors convertir le sultan hafside au christianisme et le dresser contre le souverain d'Égypte afin de forcer ce dernier à se retirer de Jérusalem. L'échec de cette stratégie marque la fin des croisades. Une cathédrale est élevée au XIXe siècle sur la colline de Byrsa, à l'endroit présumé de sa sépulture.\nJusqu'à la redécouverte de Carthage au XIXe siècle, les ruines sont pillées pour ses marbres afin de construire, en Afrique comme en Europe, des édifices publics ou religieux.\nComme lieu d'habitation, il ne reste que deux hameaux, peuplés de paysans et d'agriculteurs, situés à Douar Chott et à La Malga.\n\nDe la période beylicale à nos jours\nC'est au XIXe siècle que certains hauts dignitaires de l'État beylical choisissent Carthage pour villégiature estivale. Le premier à s'y installer est Mustapha Khaznadar avec un palais à Salammbô, en bord de mer près des ports puniques, puis un autre sur les hauteurs de Byrsa, devenu une école de cadres. Ensuite, le général mamelouk Ahmed Zarrouk construit le palais Zarrouk, devenu la résidence officielle de Lamine Bey, puis un night-club après l'abolition de la monarchie, pour devenir le siège de l'Académie tunisienne des sciences, des lettres et des arts. L'influent favori de Sadok Bey, le ministre Mustapha Ben Ismaïl construit également un palais, devenu une académie de police à Douar Chott après avoir été la propriété de Hédi Bey et de ses descendants de 1882 à la confiscation du palais. Ces résidences de style tunisien s'entourent progressivement de plus petites résidences d'été appartenant aux notables et bourgeois tunisois.\nCe n'est qu'en 1906 qu'on note l'apparition des premières villas à l'européenne dont les plus importantes sont celles du secrétaire général du gouvernement tunisien, fonctionnaire colonial français et véritable Premier ministre du pays. Cette villa sera choisie par Habib Bourguiba pour devenir le palais présidentiel de Carthage en 1960. On note aussi à Salammbô, près des ports puniques, la construction vers 1930 de la villa du général Laignelot, commandant de l'armée française et ministre de la Guerre du bey, devenue la villa Terzi, de même que les villas des caïds Habib Djellouli et Salem Snadly aux abords de la colline de Byrsa. Le Corbusier réalise entre 1928 et 1929, à Carthage-Présidence, son unique œuvre tunisienne : la villa Baizeau.\nLa municipalité de Carthage est créée par un décret beylical le 15 juin 1919. Le développement de son périmètre communal ainsi que l'accroissement de sa population conduisent à la création de l'arrondissement municipal de Carthage-Mohamed Ali le 25 octobre 1983. En février 1985, Ugo Vetere (en) et Chedli Klibi, maires de Rome et Carthage, signent de manière symbolique le traité de Carthage, un traité de paix mettant officiellement fin à la dernière guerre ayant opposé les deux cités, la troisième guerre punique.\nDepuis, Carthage est devenue une petite ville résidentielle du Grand Tunis. Elle devient un lieu de résidence recherché des hauts fonctionnaires, diplomates et industriels. La mosquée Mâlik ibn Anas est inaugurée le 11 novembre 2003 sur la colline de l'odéon après la destruction d'immeubles résidentiels datant de la période coloniale.\n\nArchitecture et urbanisme\nSite archéologique\nAperçu général\nLe site archéologique de Carthage, dispersé dans la ville moderne, est classé au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis 1979. Dominé par la colline de Byrsa qui était le centre de la cité punique, il se distingue par la silhouette massive de la cathédrale Saint-Louis édifiée à l'emplacement présumé de la sépulture du roi Louis IX qui y mourut au cours de la huitième croisade. Pour l'anecdote, le roi Louis-Philippe Ier, qui descend de Louis IX, envoya un architecte à Carthage pour en trouver l'emplacement le plus précis. Au vu de l'impossibilité d'une telle mission, celui-ci choisit simplement le plus bel endroit. À proximité de la cathédrale, en face de cette tombe vide dont les restes ont été rapatriés en France, se trouvent les vestiges du plus important quartier de la ville dont il ne subsiste que quelques fondations et quelques fragments de colonnes.\nForte de son héritage historique, Carthage se développe et devient une vaste banlieue résidentielle de Tunis autour du palais présidentiel. Toutefois, le développement rapide de la ville moderne risquant de détruire à jamais les vestiges, de grands archéologues tunisiens ont alerté l'opinion et l'Unesco a lancé une vaste campagne internationale entre 1972 et 1992 afin de sauver Carthage. Ce tournant est parachevé avec le classement au patrimoine mondial.\nLa difficulté pour le visiteur réside aujourd'hui dans l'extrême dispersion des vestiges même si certains pôles peuvent être distingués.\n\nÉléments dispersés\nSur le sommet de la colline de Byrsa, emplacement du forum romain, a été mis au jour un quartier d'habitation punique du dernier siècle d'existence de la ville, daté plus précisément du début du IIe siècle. L'habitat est typique et même stéréotypé, avec un local sur la rue pouvant être utilisé comme magasin, une citerne étant installée au sous-sol afin de récupérer l'eau destinée à l'utilisation domestique, et un long couloir sur le côté droit qui mène à une cour percée d'un puisard et autour de laquelle se succèdent de petites pièces en nombre variable. Non loin de la mer, une zone de la ville punique a été fouillée par des archéologues allemands. Ils y ont découvert un pan du rempart qui protégeait la cité au Ve siècle av. J.-C. ainsi que tout un quartier d'habitation dont ils ont pu décrypter l'évolution durant les deux siècles précédant la destruction de 146 av. J.-C..\nLe théâtre du IIe siècle a fait l'objet d'une importante restauration, les restes d'époque romaine étant très modestes. De l'édifice conçu pour accueillir 5 000 spectateurs ne subsistaient que de faibles ruines au début du XXe siècle, tant des gradins que de la scène ou du frons scænæ. À proximité du théâtre a été mise au jour une zone constituant de nos jours le parc dit des « villas romaines ». Il abrite, outre la célèbre « villa de la volière », du nom de la mosaïque principale qui la décore, de nombreux vestiges significatifs liés à la disposition des lieux.\nLes nécropoles puniques qui ont fait l'objet d'une identification, d'un nombre supérieur à 3 500, sont relativement disséminées dans la ville et forment une sorte d'arc de cercle au milieu duquel se situait l'habitat. Contrairement aux nécropoles puniques, celles de l'époque romaine se trouvaient hors des limites de la cité. Les fouilles récentes ont mis en évidence plusieurs cimetières, dont celui des officiales, réservés aux fonctionnaires de l'administration proconsulaire aux abords des citernes de La Malga.\n\nLes thermes d'Antonin furent édifiés en bord de mer après un grand incendie qui ravagea la cité au IIe siècle, plus précisément entre 145 et 162. Des installations d'origine ne demeurent que quelques vestiges du rez-de-chaussée, constitué par les espaces de service, à proximité du rivage.\nDe l'amphithéâtre d'une capacité de 30 000 personnes ne demeure que l'arène, le reste ayant disparu en raison des pilleurs de monuments qui ont sévi à Carthage pendant plus d'un millénaire. Un sort analogue a été réservé au cirque, ce dernier n'étant plus suggéré que par une longue dépression à proximité de Douar Chott.\nLe tophet, situé non loin de deux lagunes dénommées l'une « port marchand » et l'autre « port militaire » constituant la trace des anciens ports puniques, est un enclos sacré où les Carthaginois auraient sacrifié leurs enfants aux divinités protectrices Tanit et Ba'al Hammon selon une historiographie bien ancrée, mais remise en cause par certains spécialistes, particulièrement Sabatino Moscati.\n\nÉdifices religieux contemporains\nLa mosquée Mâlik ibn Anas a été érigée au lieu-dit « la colline de l'odéon », sur un site d'une superficie de trois hectares.\n\nC'est le président de la République tunisienne de l'époque, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, qui l'a inaugurée le 11 novembre 2003. Bâtie sur une esplanade de 2 500 m2, elle comporte un minaret haut de 55 mètres et une salle de prière pouvant accueillir plus de 1 000 fidèles.\nLa cathédrale Saint-Louis de Carthage, située au sommet de la colline de Byrsa, est une ancienne cathédrale catholique aujourd'hui désaffectée pour le culte. L'édifice est de style byzantino-mauresque en forme de croix latine et sa façade encadrée de deux tours carrées. Aux murs figurent les blasons des donateurs pour la construction de la basilique. Les vitraux sont aussi décorés d'arabesques.\nÉdifiée entre 1884 et 1890, sous le protectorat français, la cathédrale devient primatiale d'Afrique lorsque le titre de primat d'Afrique est restauré au profit du cardinal Lavigerie. C'était aussi un séminaire pour les pères blancs.\n\nCulture\nLe Festival international de Carthage est un événement culturel renommé qui est organisé chaque été au théâtre antique. Les Journées cinématographiques de Carthage, festival biennal de cinéma lancé en 1966 par le ministère de la Culture tunisien, se déroulent sans interruption depuis leur création, en alternance avec les Journées théâtrales de Carthage.\n\nSur la colline de Byrsa, le musée national de Carthage est situé dans les locaux occupés par les pères blancs. Il permet au visiteur de se rendre compte de l'ampleur des installations de la ville aux époques punique puis romaine. Certaines des plus belles pièces trouvées dans les fouilles depuis le XIXe siècle s'y trouvent, les autres étant présentées au musée national du Bardo près de Tunis. À proximité immédiate, l'ancienne cathédrale Saint-Louis est désormais utilisée comme espace culturel et baptisée Acropolium. Elle accueille régulièrement expositions et concerts, notamment le festival Jazz à Carthage créé en 2005.\nParmi les autres institutions qui siègent à Carthage figure l'Académie tunisienne des sciences, des lettres et des arts installée depuis 1983 dans un ancien palais, propriété du général Zarrouk, ministre de la Guerre de Sadok Bey, acquis en 1922 par Habib Bey et légué à Lamine Bey, dernier représentant de la dynastie husseinite. L'Institut national des sciences et technologies de la mer, fondé en 1924, est un établissement public de recherche basé à Salammbô. Il possède un petit musée : le musée océanographique de Salammbô.\nEn matière d'enseignement, la ville abrite quelques établissements renommés comme l'Institut des hautes études commerciales de Carthage et l'Institut supérieur des cadres de l'enfance. Le réseau éducatif compte aussi cinq écoles et quatre lycées dont le lycée Carthage Présidence construit en 1952.\n\nPolitique\nLe poste de maire est occupé depuis le 6 juillet 2018 par Hayet Bayoudh, candidate de Nidaa Tounes passée ensuite chez Tahya Tounes. Elle a sous sa responsabilité le secrétariat général et les différents services de l'administration municipale. Parmi ses prédécesseurs figurent les ministres Chedli Klibi (1963-1990) et Fouad Mebazaa (1995-1998).\nL'hôtel de ville, construit au début du XXe siècle, regroupe les différents bureaux du Conseil municipal et de l'administration. Les recettes du budget municipal sont le produit de taxes sur les immeubles bâtis, les terrains non bâtis et les entreprises, la taxe hôtelière et celle sur les spectacles ainsi que les contributions des propriétaires riverains.\n\nLa Carthage moderne, outre sa vocation résidentielle, semble aussi devoir être investie d'un rôle politique de plus en plus affirmé, tant symbolique que de fait.\nCarthage a accueilli un palais beylical puis, après la proclamation de la République, le lieu de résidence officielle du président de la République tunisienne ; celui-ci, construit par le président Habib Bourguiba, est situé sur le rivage, à proximité des thermes d'Antonin.\nLa configuration géographique de Carthage, en ancienne presqu'île, met la ville à l'abri des éventuels inconvénients et embarras de Tunis et accroît son attraction comme lieu de résidence auprès des élites. Si Carthage n'est pas la capitale, elle tend à être le pôle politique, un « lieu de pouvoir emblématique » d'après Sophie Bessis, réservant à Tunis les rôles administratifs et économiques.\n\nAdministration\nLa municipalité de Carthage est divisée en trois arrondissements : Carthage, Carthage Mohamed Ali et El Yasmina.\n\nÉconomie\nCarthage est une ville essentiellement résidentielle, donc dépourvue d'activités économiques significatives. Toutefois, le rayonnement culturel du site archéologique et le charme de certaines municipalités voisines contribuent à faire de Carthage une pièce maîtresse des circuits touristiques et un lieu d'excursion privilégié. Néanmoins, la ville est quasiment dépourvue d'infrastructures dans ce domaine ; l'absence de grandes plages, les plus proches étant situées plus au nord, en est sans doute l'une des causes.\n\nTransport\nCarthage est desservie par la ligne ferroviaire du TGM qui traverse la ville et la relie à La Goulette et Tunis au sud-ouest et Sidi Bou Saïd et La Marsa au nord. Six stations se trouvent sur son territoire : Carthage Salammbô, Carthage Byrsa, Carthage Dermech, Carthage Hannibal, Carthage Présidence et Carthage Amilcar.\nDiverses lignes de bus de la Société des transports de Tunis relient la ville à d'autres points de l'agglomération comme l'Ariana et Tunis.\n\nSport\nL'Union sportive de Carthage est un club sportif représentant la région de Carthage et connu pour ses performances en volley-ball ; le Club féminin de Carthage est son pendant féminin. Le Tennis Club de Carthage est également actif dans la ville.\n\nJumelages\nCarthage est jumelée à quatre villes :\n\n Carthagène (Espagne) depuis le 10 janvier 1989\n Aix-en-Provence (France) depuis le 28 janvier 1993\n Versailles (France) depuis le 28 juin 1998\n Tyr (Liban) depuis le 20 octobre 2002\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nAzedine Beschaouch, La légende de Carthage, Paris, Gallimard, coll. « Découvertes Gallimard / Archéologie » (no 172), 1993, 176 p.

      "content": "## Overview\nThe ruins of Carthage (Arabic: قرطاج, Qarṭāj) are in Tunisia, 15 km north of Tunis.\n\n## Understand\nA Phoenician city from the 6th century BCE, it was the base of a powerful trading empire spanning the entire south Mediterranean and home to a population of the order of half a million people. The legendary founder, Queen Dido, bought from the locals 'as much land as a cow's skin can cover', and by cutting finely the skin of the cow, gained Byrsa Hill.\nIts most famous general was Hannibal, who brought elephants across the Alps to battle with the Romans. He was defeated by the Roman general Scipio \"Africanus\" at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE, which ended the 2nd Punic War. After over 50 years of being watched closely by Rome, they were eventually attacked in the 3rd Punic War. Carthage lost and the city was completely destroyed by order of the Roman Senate. The site was redeveloped by the Romans a century later and Carthage became the capital of the Roman province of Africa. Today, it is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Byrsa Hill at the rear of the area dominates both the ocean gulf and the lake and plain of Tunis inland to the west, and is therefore the most strategic point.\nToday the district is very affluent, with elite schools, wealthy residents, relatively numerous police, a large number of archaeological sites and museums and the President's own seaside residence.\n\n## Get in\nTake the TGM light rail line from Tunis to one of the following stations:\n36.8666210.337461 Carthage-Amilcar — only useful for the American Cemetery\n36.8616710.335012 Carthage-Présidence — for the Basilica of Saint Cyprien, or a walk past the President's palace\n36.8535510.328973 Carthage-Hannibal — most destinations including Antonine Baths, Roman Theatre and the hill-top Carthage Museum/Acropolium/Carthage Archaeological Park complex\n36.8501110.32564 Carthage-Dermech\n36.8462510.321815 Carthage-Byrsa — Oceanographic Museum, Punic Tophet and its nearby hotel\n36.8418510.319146 Carthage-Salammbo\n\n## Get around\nMostly it's best to walk.  However, the area is large and sightseeing is sweaty work on a hot day.\n\n## By taxi\nIf you are tired, you may wish to get a cab between some of the major tourist spots.  This should be cheaper in low season.\n\n## Carthage\nLots and lots of ruins! The president's palace. Sweeping views of Tunis and the gulf.\nAs of June 2025 you buy a ticket, costing 12 DT, which allows access to 10 different historic sites/museums, which are a big challenge to see in one day. This is now the only ticket on sale. You can’t buy tickets for individual sites. Only some sites have extensive English signage - many, such as the museum, do not. Some are not open, and most signposts pointing to where they are sketchy at best.\nThe most impressive sights (with better preserved ruins) are Antonin Baths and Byrsa Hill near the Carthage Museum. Amphitheater, Hill of the Odeon, and Water Cisterns are much smaller but still interesting.\n36.854310.33511 Antonin Baths. Ruins of the largest Roman baths outside Rome itself. The site also has a Punic cemetery, some old houses, some Punic kilns, a chapel, some graves, and mosaics. Guides are available in a number of languages, and may be worthwhile as the site is large. It is illegal to take photographs in the direction of the presidential palace. Doing so, especially when traveling alone, may land you in jail for up to 3 years, though the guards don't appear too concerned.      (updated Nov 2018)\n36.85314210.3243952 Carthage Museum. 8:30AM–5:30PM (until 7PM in the summer). Most remnants excavated from the ruins have been stored in the cavernous museum located on Byrsa Hill, documenting both the Punic and the Roman eras. Signs within the museum are entirely in Arabic and French. On the second floor, the part nearer to the staircases showcase artifacts from Roman times, and the inner part the artifacts of the earlier Punic period. Fascinating artifacts such as alabaster jars and jewelry remain. The descriptions of the Roman conquest and the legend of Dixon are also vivid, but sadly, inaccesible to English speakers. The museum grounds offer sweeping views of the coast and city, and also include the ruins of some Punic streets, the former site of a public library, numerous sculptures, a chapel or church, some excellent mosaics and some coffins. A few benches under the trees with a great view make for a good resting spot. Unfortunately many items about the grounds are unlabelled, so a guide may be useful (or eavesdrop on a tour group if you can). Ignore the shifty guy trying to charge you 1 DT to use the toilet. As of Nov 2018 visitors are allowed to access museum grounds only, while museum building is closed for reconstruction.      (updated Nov 2018)\n36.85378410.3233563 Acropolium (St. Louis Cathedral). St Louis Cathedral forms one edge of the museum, but does not appear to be open - it was completed in 1890.   (updated Nov 2018)\n36.8593110.3188074 Water Cisterns. A very large series of water cisterns which functioned as a water redistribution point at the terminus of a long (90 km?) aqueduct from the hills to the south. The remnants of the end of the aqueduct are still standing. Also offers reasonable views of the city. Free.    (updated Nov 2018)\n36.8561210.3150785 Amphitheater. An eviscerated Roman amphitheatre constructed in the first century CE, ringed by forested, rolling hills. Interesting for a quick stroll, but it is unlabelled in any language. May therefore be more interesting with an enthusiastic guide. Worth a look. The adjacent forest may be a nice spot for a picnic. Entrance fee included in the 10-site ticket.      (updated Nov 2018)\n36.8413110.322956 Punic Tophet (Salammbo Tophet), Rue Hannibal (It's the island like part that juts out into a circular bay - road signs can be misleading). A frustratingly unlabelled, but large collection of what appear to be children's grave stones. Many stones have simplistic symbols carved in to them. There are also a few half-buried structures. Guide or background reading recommended. Accessible with multi-site ticket.    (updated Nov 2018)\n36.863810.3387 Basilica of Saint-Cyprien, North of Carthage Présidence Station along Route La Goulette/Rue de Rue de Maroc (Walk north a few hundred metres from the station, turn right with the sign just after the bridge and petrol station to your left.). This historic Christian temple was surrounded by a vast cemetery. Rediscovered in 1915, it was oriented toward a spectacular ocean view which can still be enjoyed. The temple is thought to have been dedicated to the well being of seafarers. All of the valuable remains have been removed, leaving the site somewhat empty. On the plus side, it makes a good picnic spot and there's a chocolate and pastry store right nearby with a service station opposite for drinks. Located very far north relative to most of the Carthaginian ruin sites, this is a good option for the start of a long day's walking. Free.    (updated Nov 2018)\n36.85710.33768 Presidential Palace (Carthage Palace), Route La Goulette (Between Carthage-Hannibal and Carthage-Présidence stations, on the hill. Look for the national flags!). You can walk past the president's well-guarded palace, which includes a private boat moor and helicopter pad, on the main road. You can also see it from the Antonine Baths, and the ruins above (cross under the TGM railway bridge, then turn right up the hill). Off limits to public, but it's free to view from afar.      (updated Nov 2018)\n36.858110.33089 Hill of the Odeon and park of the Roman villas. Accessible with multi-site ticket.      (updated Nov 2018)\n36.850810.313710 Circus of Carthage. A Roman circus used for chariot racing, it was modeled on the Circus Maximus in Rome and other circus buildings throughout the Roman Empire. Measuring more than 470 m in length and 30 m in width, it could house up to 45,000 spectators. Not much left of it nowadays though. Free.      (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Other sights\n36.86516810.3298611 World War II North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial (Just north of Carthage, a five-minute walk from the Amilcar Station). daily except for December 25 and January 1; 9AM-5PM. The cemetery is the final resting place for 2,841 American military Dead lost during the War in North Africa. A monument is inscribed with the names of 3,724 Americans whose remains were never found or identified. The memorial court contains large maps in mosaic and ceramic depicting operations across Africa. Free.\n36.84326310.3257712 Musée Océanographique Dar El Hout (Oceanographic Museum), 28, rue du 2 mars Salammbô (Walk east toward the water from Carthage Salammbo station), then follow the lake), ☏ +216 71 730420. 10:00-13:00,15-18:00 (winter), 09:00-12:00,16:00-19:00 (summer). Built in 1924 under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on the site of the Carthaginian war harbour. Collection of stuffed birds and animals, several aquariums, skeletons of fossil fishes. 0.5 DT.     (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Do\nInternational Festival of Carthage. In the summer is a treat with big name dancers, singers, and artists from all over the world for a very reasonable price (10.5 DT). Plastic chairs are not worth the price (26 DT) unless you are really aching for back-support. Most people bring cushions or blankets for the amphitheatre seats. Plan a late night out with concerts normally ending after 1AM.\n\n## Buy\nOther than tourist trinkets, unless you are looking for high end furniture or daily use commodities and food you may find your options limited.\n\n## Eat\nThere are a number of eateries scattered around the district, though most lie outside of the major tourist trail.\n\n## Carthage-Byrsa and Carthage-Salammbo Area\nThere is a restaurant-hotel with a relatively expensive but good selection (including wines) near the Punic Tophet on Rue de Hannibal south of the southerly Carthage-Byrsa station, east of Carthage-Salammbo. It's not far from the Oceanographic Museum\nNorth of Carthage-Byrsa, two local sandwich shops can provide cheap eats and coffee.\nOn the main road Route La Goulette between Carthage-Byrsa and Carthage-Salammbo stations, there is a restaurant that offers a range of salads, meat dishes, sandwiches, and pizza.\n36.8463710.321611 Le Rest'O, Byrsa, ☏ +216 71 733 433. Mediterranean cuisine and classy interior design. Great views of all of the city and the bay.\n\n## Carthage-Hannibal\n36.8533510.334392 Antonin Baths cafe. A small cafe on the Antonin Baths premises. Hot/cold drinks and some snacks.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Carthage-Présidence\n36.86410.336663 Sale sucre (on the corner in front of the Basilica of Saint Cyprien). Doesn't operate in off-season. A tiny patisserie. Drinks can be acquired opposite at the gas station.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Drink\nThe hotel/restaurant on Rue de Hannibal, just south-west of the Punic Tophet, offers a wine selection, though all are Tunisian and overpriced.  Beers also appear to be available.\n\n## Sleep\n36.85239210.3230451 Villa Didon (next to the main Carthage ruins atop Byrsa Hill). This pricey hotel/spa offers food near the Carthage Museum. It features a stylish lounge and terrace with delightful views. Very pleasant for an evening beer or glass of wine, though apparently closed during off season. From 634 TN.    (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Go next\nLa Goulette\nLa Marsa\nSidi Bou Said - this charming town is just a few train stops from Carthage and is a great place to eat and watch the sunset\nTunis — the laid-back capital of Tunisia with a very authentic souk",
