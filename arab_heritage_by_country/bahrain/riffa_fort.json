The fort is situated on a cliff overlooked the desert valley between East Riffa and West Riffa.\n\nHistory\nIn the early 18th century, a fort was built here by Fareer bin Rahhal. Over time, the fort fell and only the foundation remained. Later, during the reign of Sheikh Salman bin Ahmed Al Fateh Al Khalifa, he rebuilt the fort using the existing foundation in 1812. The fort was used for defense and the residence of Shaikh Salman bin Al Fateh.\nIn the 19th century the fort was a residence for Sheikh Salman bin Ahmed Al Fateh and then it was inherited by his grand children. Sheikh Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa, who ruled Bahrain from 1869 to 1932, was born in this fort.\n\nSee also\nList of archaeological sites in Bahrain\n\n\n== References ==",
