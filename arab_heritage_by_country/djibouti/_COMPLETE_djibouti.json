          "content": "Djibouti (also called Djibouti City and Jibuti in early Western texts) is the capital city of the Republic of Djibouti. It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the Gulf of Tadjoura.\nDjibouti has a population of around 780,000 inhabitants, which counts for 73% of the country's population. The settlement was founded in 1888 by the French, on land leased from the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans. During the ensuing period, it served as the capital of French Somaliland and its successor the French Territory of the Afars and Issas.\n\nHistory\nThere is evidence of human settlement on the eastern coastline of Djibouti dating back to the Bronze Age.\n\nFrom 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura was called Obock and was ruled by Issa and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region. The exchange of Franco-British diplomatic notes of 2 and 9 February 1888 fixed the territorial limit between the colonies of the two countries; leaving explicitly under French authority the southern coasts of the Gulf of Tadjoura, including a peninsula composed of insubmersible plateaux, Ras Djibouti as a highly strategic location, a future bridgehead for French designs in the rest of Africa and Asia. It is then that this point begins to be used as departure for caravans towards Harar.\n\nThe French subsequently founded Djibouti in 1888, in a previously uninhabited stretch of coast.  According to one account, this was due to \"its superiority to Obok both in respect to harbour accommodation and in nearness to Harrar.\" Ambouli was a small village before the French arrived, about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) south of Ras Djiboutil. Ambouli is identified with the city of Canbala by O.G.S. Crawford, appearing in Muhammad al-Idrisi's map of 1192 on the coast of the Horn of Africa, southeast of the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and with Cambaleh, a town where the Venetian traveler Bragadino, a thirteenth-century European visitor to Ethiopia, resided for eight years. In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of French Somaliland.\nThe main purpose of the French interest in colonizing the region was to protect their trade routes to Madagascar and Indochina from the encroachment of other European powers. The town later grew considerably in size following the construction of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway. In 1895, Djibouti, which, not so long ago, was just a peninsula, already had 5,000 inhabitants. Many Issa and Afar nomads left their herds to settle here, built houses on what is now the downtown area. They became dockers and constitute the first local proletariat. The French and natives built hotels, houses, mosques and churches. The Yemeni, Egyptian, Greek, Armenian and Italian merchants and traders flocked to this promise that Djibouti represented. Additionally, the rich agricultural southern area of Ambouli continued to flourish due to an abundance of date palm farms and orchards. Djibouti did not attract as many boats as Aden. In 1896, Léonce Lagarde became the first governor of the French Somali Coast, a new name for the French dependencies in the region. At the start of the 20th century, Djibouti had 10,000 inhabitants and was considered a major regional port. Its main activity remains the supply of French ships en route to Indochina or Madagascar. Only 150,000 tonnes of freight per year were handled. In addition, the railway line has not yet been fully exploited.\nAlthough the initial French efforts to establish commercial influence in the region proved to be unsuccessful enough to require a government bailout, the Franco-Ethiopian Railway itself was a success and allowed Djibouti's commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby Zeila in British Somaliland. Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden, including trade in Harari coffee and khat. Djibouti began to develop as a commercial center.  On 12 July 1926, the Fontainebleau, a Messageries Maritimes steamer loaded with cotton and heading for China caught fire while approaching Djibouti. The captain decided to flood the holds and run aground his ship in the middle of the harbor of Djibouti, causing significant inconvenience for port traffic. The city then proposed using the wreck as a promontory of a new deep-water port, connecting it to the Marabout plateau by a 700-meter jetty. The idea was accepted and work began in 1931. The first phase was completed in 1935 and considerably increased port and rail traffic. In 1933, Djibouti was the first town to be wired to electricity in French Somaliland, and an oil terminal was built in 1937.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Djibouti was hit by Italian airstrikes on 21 June 1940, which killed many people in the town. The anti-aircraft fire was intense and two Italian aircraft failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti. Overnight, several waves of Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers attacked the port facilities. After the defeat of France the colony came under the control of the pro-Axis Vichy government. By that time, the Allied offensive against the Italians included a blockade of French Somaliland. On 25 September the RAF launched several airstrikes on the city, prompting governor Pierre Nouailhetas to institute a brutal reign of terror against Europeans and African inhabitants of the city. Famine set in and malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children, and many townsfolk left for the hinterland. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. The head doctor at the hospital committed suicide in despair. Only a few Arab dhows (boutres) managed to run the blockade to Djibouti and Obock and only two French ships from Madagascar managed to run it.\nThe Japanese declaration of war (7 December 1941) gave the colony some respite, since the Royal Navy were forced to withdraw all but two ships from the blockade for use in the Far East. The rule of Nouailhetas was too brutal for even the authoritarian leaders at Vichy to stand for. In October 1942 he was recalled and forced to retire without a pension, Following the war, he escaped to Portugal. He returned to face a military tribunal and was acquitted on 17 July 1953, which sparked outrage in Djibouti. \nThe Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland \"Pentagon\", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont, the governor of French Somaliland, surrendered and Colonel Raynal's troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle.\nIn 1946, Djibouti received the status of overseas territory. An elected territorial assembly was created then, in 1956, a government council charged, under the chairmanship of the head of the territory, with the management of local affairs. At the same time, fiscal, customs and monetary measures are put in place to promote the development of the deep-water port, to finally compete with Aden. Port facilities expanded considerably and could afford to accommodate 2,000 ships per year. Djibouti becomes a free port and abandons the free zone. In 1948, a new currency, the Côte Française des Somalis, was created, pegged to the gold standard and convertible into dollars.\n\nIn August 1966, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General Charles de Gaulle, was also met with demonstrations and rioting. In response to the protests, de Gaulle ordered another referendum. On 19 March 1967, a second plebiscite was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. However, the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities, voters rejected independence by a 50-point margin. Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths.\nThe population of Djibouti was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947. In 1949, the plan of Djibouti consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding French Territory of the Afars and Issas.\nWhen Djibouti declared Independence on 27 June 1977, the population of Djibouti was over 110,000, the city has since served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.\n\nClimate\nDjibouti has an arid climate (Köppen: BWh). It is characterised by very hot rainless summers and a very warm, slightly wetter winter season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. The city sees on average 163.5 millimetres (6.44 in) of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from 29 °C (84 °F) during the months of December, January and February, to about 42 °C (108 °F) in July. There are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the coast usually occurs between November and March, whereas further inland it falls between April and October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed 40 °C (104 °F), with relative humidity at its lowest point of the year. Sunshine is abundant in the city, averaging eight to ten hours a day year-round. It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal fog and greater cloud coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal 224 millimetres (8.82 in) falling in November 1949.\nThis climate zone has summers that reach a maximum temperature of 41.7 °C (107.1 °F) and a minimum temperature of 32 °C (90 °F). Winters have average nighttime temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F) and a daytime maximum temperatures of 29 °C (84 °F). There are barely any days in the year without sunshine, and even during the winter there are many clear days.\n\nDemographics\nDjibouti is a multi-ethnic town. It had a population of around 777,000 residents (including suburbs like Balbala) in 2024, making it by far the largest settlement in the country. The largest ethnic group are the Somali and the second largest being Afars, both Cushitic speaking Cushitic peoples. The population of Djibouti City has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. Many of the immigrants arrived from Ethiopia and Somalia in 1985 and 1991. In 2001 many undocumented immigrants, were expelled from Djibouti. Another mass wave of Yemeni refugees from Yemen arrived in 2015. Djibouti City was nicknamed the \"French Hong Kong in the Red Sea\" due to its cosmopolitan urbanism. In 2023, the government of Djibouti launched a major campaign to combat illegal immigration, citing security and public health concerns.\nThe majority of local residents speak Somali (303,100 speakers) or Afar (101,200 speakers) as a first language, which are the mother tongues of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively and the two main demographic groups in the city. Both languages belong to the larger Afroasiatic family. There are two official languages in Djibouti: Arabic (Afroasiatic) and French (Indo-European).\nArabic is of social, cultural and religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of Modern Standard Arabic. Colloquially, about 40,000 local residents speak the Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect, also known as Southern Yemeni Arabic due to Yemeni immigrants. French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 14,200 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include Omani Arabic (38,900 speakers) and Amharic (1,400 speakers).\nDjibouti's population is predominantly Muslim. Islam is observed by 94% of the nation's population (around 740,000 as of 2012), whereas the remaining 6% of residents are Christian adherents. The Diocese of Djibouti serves the small local Catholic population, which it estimates numbered around 7,000 individuals in 2006.\n\nReligion\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Roman Catholic Diocese of Djibouti (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.\n\nAdministration\nDjibouti has the distinction of being both a city and an administrative province. The Djibouti Region is one of the six regions of Djibouti. It borders the Gulf of Tadjoura and Gulf of Aden to the north and east, and the Arta Region to the south and west. The Djibouti Region is the smallest province in the country, but contains the national capital, Djibouti, and thus is the region with the greatest population of people. Djibouti Region occupies an area of 200 square kilometres (77 square miles).\n\nLocal government\nThe administration of Djibouti City is formed of three municipalities: The commune of Ras-Dika, commune of Boulaos and commune of Balbala. The Djibouti City Council elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints deputies. The mayor of Djibouti City, who has executive powers, and the National Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year, are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements.\n\nNational government\nDjibouti City is the seat of the Government of Djibouti. Many government departments, as well as the President's residence at the presidential palace are based. The National Assembly (formerly the Chamber of Deputies) is the country's legislature consisting of 65 members elected every five years. Although unicameral, the Constitution provides for the creation of a senate. The Social Development Agency of Djibouti (Agence de Développement Sociale de Djibouti) has its head offices here, as does the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) trade bloc. Additionally, the Regional Somali Language Academy, a language regulator established in June 2013 by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia, has its headquarters in the city.\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Djibouti reflects the city's history since the early 1890s and is marked by both native Djiboutians, Yemeni, French and modern buildings. The old section is filled with bazaars and souks nestled along narrow streets. Djibouti City has wide streets, restaurants, Plaza (town squares) and cafes while many of the boulevards are lined with trees. It is serves as both a center for commerce and entertainment, as well as a residential area. To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being constructed in and around the city. A few of the building fronts have been renovated and date back to the 19th century. The Place of 27 June in the city center is also distinguished by its Moorish-inspired arches. Due to its numerous exotic edifices and structures, the city has also been likened to a European settlement. Since independence, the people of Djibouti have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques. Notable taller architecture in Djibouti City includes the Mezz Tower, SALAAM Tower and East Africa Bank. Djibouti City is the headquarters of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nMain sights\nMuseums, libraries and theatres\nThe Théâtre des Salines opened in 1965 as an important cultural landmark in the national capital. Open-air, in the form of an arena; with concrete bleachers, the Théâtre des Salines is a mythical place for Djiboutians who were born before the country's independence. Indeed, this place has hosted many shows for several decades (plays, concerts, one man show etc...).\nThe National Archives and Library of Djibouti hosts many artifacts and artistic treasures in Djibouti, it holds many culturally important artefacts, including old coins, bartering tools, traditional artwork, ancient weaponry and pottery items.\n\nPalaces\nThe presidential palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of Djibouti. It overlooks the Gulf of Tadjoura, with access to both the harbour and airport. The Governor's Palace of Djibouti was the seat of the governor of French Somaliland and French Territory of the Afars and the Issas from 1884 to 1977.\n\nInstitutes\nThe Regional Somali Language Academy is an intergovernmental regulating body for the Somali language in the Horn region. On 28 June 2013, the Government of Djibouti, the Federal Government of Somalia and the Government of Ethiopia launched the Regional Somali Language Academy at a ceremony in Djibouti City. The event was organized by Djibouti's Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Culture and Waqf in conjunction with the Somali-Speaking PEN Centre of Djibouti, and was attended by around 50 prominent Somali-speaking intellectuals from the region and elsewhere. Among the guests were Somalia's Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Abdullahi Elmoge Hersi, Somaliland’s Minister of Culture Abiib Diriye Nur, and the Vice President of the Somali Region of Ethiopia Abdihakim Igal Omar.\n\nParks\nDjibouti has several public parks. The largest of these is the Lagarde Park.\n\nEconomy\nDjibouti City economy, like that of Djibouti, is dominated by trade, most local businesses have their headquarters in the city. Djibouti Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in the country, is based here. During its existence, Djibouti Airlines also had its head office in the city. Djibouti City is the financial hub to many entrepreneurial industries ranging from construction, retail, import and export, money transfer companies, and Internet cafés.\nDjibouti City main trading ports, is a trading hub linking Europe, the Far East, the Horn of Africa and the Persian Gulf. An estimated 2,500 ships pass through and call through the port every day. The Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) is a special economic zone located to the west of the city, which is subject to different economic regulations. The city's port is the terminus for Ethiopian oil transport and export. Increase in railway infrastructure has further enabled Ethiopian and Eritrean oil products to reach the capital.\n\nBanking\nThe banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Djibouti's economy. The financial sector of the Republic of Djibouti has grown dramatically in recent years, a process that began in the early 2000s, and that was in large part prompted by an explosion the number of exchange agencies and remittances throughout the country. The Djiboutian financial sector, with total assets of 265 billion DJF or 10.2 per cent of GDP, has not been affected by the international financial crisis. Djibouti has been considered an oasis of peace and a model of political stability in a region.\n\nTourism\nTourism in Djibouti is centred in the Djibouti region. City landmarks include historic buildings, two important public squares, and the Hall of the People. Many private companies offer organized tours of these sites.\nThe two small Maskali and Moucha islands are situated an hour's boat ride from Djibouti. They feature madreporic mangroves, with a rich seabed and colourful algae. Various fish species can also be found in the local coral gardens, including groupers, jacks and barracuda.\n\nTransport\nRoad\nDjibouti is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public transport network. Roads leading out of the city connect it to other national localities and to Somalia and Ethiopia. Public transportation is provided through buses stationed at the Djibouti Bus Service Enterprise. The city at large serves as a point of intersection for the main roads and highways linking different parts of the country. It is one of the most accessible urban areas in the country, where one can find public and private transportation 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. A significant number of the city's residents use the local informal minibuses and taxis, which include a fleet of 400 green-and-white taxis. The main bus hub in Djibouti is the Central Bus Station, located at the crossing of Rue de Bender.\n\nAir\nDjibouti is served primarily by the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport. It is the second largest airport in the Horn of Africa, and offers flights to numerous global destinations. It is the largest airport in Djibouti and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Horn of Africa and the world. Located approximately 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, the airport was opened in 1948. Originally a modest-sized facility, the airport grew considerably in size in the post-independence period after numerous successive renovation projects. Outbound international travel from the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport accounts for the majority of all air passengers traveling to and from Djibouti. Due to its strategic location, the facility acts as a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of departures and arrivals, and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing.\n\nSea\nThe Port of Djibouti is one of the largest and busiest seaports in the Horn region. As of 2013, the container terminal at the port handles the bulk of the nation's trade. About 70% of the seaport's activity consists of imports to and exports from neighboring Ethiopia, which depends on the harbour as its main maritime outlet. The port also serves as an international refueling center and transshipment hub. In 2012, the Djiboutian government in collaboration with DP World started construction on the Doraleh Container Terminal, a third major seaport intended to further develop the national transit capacity. A$396 million project, it has the capacity to accommodate 1.5 million 6.1-metre (20 ft) container units annually. There are also daily scheduled ferry services from the Port de Peche to Tadjoura, Obock also some other destinations in Yemen, Somalia and Eritrea.\n\nRailway\nDjibouti is a terminus of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. For most of its length, the railway runs parallel to the abandoned metre-gauge Ethio-Djibouti Railway. However, the standard-gauge railway is built on a new, straighter right-of-way that allows for much higher speeds. New stations have been built outside city centres, and the old stations have been decommissioned. On 10 January 2017, the 100 km section of Djibouti side was inaugurated in a ceremony held in the new station by Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guelleh and Ethiopia's prime minister Hailemariam Dessalegn. There are two local railway stations: a passenger station at Nagad, and a freight station at the Port of Doraleh.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nDjibouti is twinned with the following places:\n\nNotable residents\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\nEbsworth, W.

          "content": "Lake Abbe, also known as Lake Abhe Bad, is a salt lake, lying on the Ethiopia-Djibouti border. It is one of a chain of six connected lakes, which also includes (from north to south) lakes Gargori, Laitali, Gummare, Bario and Afambo. The lake is the ultimate destination of the  Awash River, which is at the center of the Afar Triangle. Lake Abbe is considered one of the most inaccessible areas of the earth. The water itself is known for its flamingos.\n\nOverview\nLake Abbe is the ultimate destination of the waters of the Awash River. It lies at the Afar triple junction, the central meeting place for the three pieces of the Earth's crust, a defining feature of the Afar Depression. Here three pieces of Earth's crust are each pulling away from that central point, though not all at the same speed.\nOn the northwest shore rises Mount Dama Ali (1069 m), a dormant volcano, while along the southwestern and southern shores extend vast salt flats, 10 km in width. Besides the Awash, seasonal affluents of Lake Abbe include two wadis, the Oleldere and Abuna Merekes, which enter the lake from the west and south, crossing the salt flats. Although the present area of the lake's open water is 34,000 hectares (130 sq mi), recent droughts and extraction of water from the Awash River for irrigation has caused the water level of the lake to fall. By 1984, the surface area of the lake had decreased to two thirds of what it was in 1940. During this period about 11,500 hectares (28,000 acres) of saltflats had formed to the southwest of the lake. Lake Abbe is a hypersaline lake; water containing mineral salts flows in but there is no outflow, and pure water evaporates from the surface. It is also known as an \"amplifier lake\", the water level fluctuating dramatically in response to quite small changes in climate.\n\nThe Afar people have established a settlement near the lake's shore. Lake Abbe is known for its limestone chimneys, which reach heights of 50 m (160 ft) and from which steam spews forth. These carbonate chimneys are formed by the mixing of lake water and a deeper geothermal fluid. Flamingos can also be found on the waters.\n\nGallery\nClimate\nThe Lake Abbe's climate offers year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than 172 millimetres (7 in) mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between 30 and 40 °C (86 and 104 °F). Temperatures in the coldest months range between 21 and 30 °C (70 and 86 °F) on average.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n(in French) Photos of Lake Abbe\nILEC database entry for Lake Abbe\nRecent trip to Lake Abbe with photos (English)\nPhotographs of the limestone chimneys of Lake Abbe, February 2015",

          "content": "Tadjoura (Afar: Tagórri; Arabic: تاجوراء, romanized: Tajūrā’; Somali: Tajuura) is one of the oldest towns in Djibouti and the capital of the Tadjourah Region. The town rose to prominence in the early 19th century as an alternative port to nearby Zeila. Lying on the Gulf of Tadjoura, it is home to a population of around 19,000 inhabitants. It is the third-largest city in the country after Djibouti and Ali Sabieh.\nTadjoura has an airstrip and is linked by ferry with Djibouti City. It is also known for its whitewashed buildings and nearby beaches, along with its mosques.\n\nEtymology\nThe Afar name Tagórri derives from the noun tágor or tógor, (pl. tágar meaning \"outre à puiser\" (\"goatskin flask for drawing water\"). The name Tagórri is specifically derived from *tagór-li, which means \"qui a des outre à puiser\" (\"that which has goatskin flasks to draw water\"), in effect meaning \"abondante en eau\" (\"abundant with water\").\n\nHistory\nThe emergence of Tadjoura occurred following the rise of the Adoimara or \"white house\" of the Afar people who inhabited the southern part of the Danakil country and were allied to the rulers of Shewa. In 1810 they defeated their rivals, the Asa-yamara or \"red house\" of the Afar, which opened the way for the development of the port and the Ethiopian interior. Tadjoura then became the seat of an Afar sultan known as the Dardar, who \"claimed authority over all of the northern Adoimara Afar to the borders of Showa. However, although it was true that some sub-clans of the Adoimara roamed as far as the borders of Ifat, even the staunchest supporters of the Sultan agreed that his actual authority did not stretch beyond Lake Assal, a short distance from Tadjoura.\"\nRichard Pankhurst notes that it differed from neighboring ports by handling almost entirely the trade of Shewa and Aussa, \"rather than that of Harar or the Ogaden.\" He quotes William Cornwallis Harris' description of an annual bazaar that started each September, when \"for two months the beach is piled with merchandise, and the suburbs are crowded with camels, mules and donkeys.\" Pankhurst also cites C.T. Beke that the trade with the inhabitants of the Afar Depression was handled entirely by women, \"who loaded the camels, bought and sold while the men kept away altogether 'to avoid bloodshed, this country being the scene of constant feuds among the different tribes.'\" While Abir observes that the port is not mentioned in all of the material about the Red Sea in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, by the mid-19th century Tadjoura was thriving, \"while all the other so-called Afar sultanates along the coast were described ... as small decaying villages of no political or commercial importance.\" Tadjoura owed this success to possessing a major slave market; Pankhurst suggests that a rough estimate of 6,000 people a year left Ethiopia through Tadjoura and Zeila. The other important commodity sold in Tadjoura in the 19th century was ivory, brought by caravans from Aliyu Amba. Other goods exported included wheat, durra, honey, gold, ostrich feathers, senna, madder, and civetone. The value of trade in 1880-1 was estimated at the time as 29,656 rupees in exports and 18,513 rupees in imports.\n\nFrench Somaliland\nThe French interest in the coast of the Red Sea near Tadjoura began with Rochet d'Hericourt's exploration into Shoa (1839–42). Further exploration by Henri Lambert, French Consular Agent at Aden, and Captain Fleuriot de Langle led to a treaty of friendship and assistance between France and the sultans of Raheita, Tadjoura, and Gobaad. A skillful Somali merchant Haji Sharmarke Ali Saleh also collected a tribute of 1,200-1,600 thalers annually from the inhabitants of Tadjourah, equivalent to a massive sum in modern currency and was ousted after French resident Lambert's murder. Growing French interest in the area took place against a backdrop of British activity in Egypt and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Between 1883 and 1887, France signed various treaties with the then ruling Somali and Afar Sultans, which allowed it to expand the protectorate to include the Gulf of Tadjoura. Léonce Lagarde was subsequently installed as the protectorate's governor. In 1894, he established a permanent French administration in the city of Djibouti and named the region Côte française des Somalis (French Somaliland). The slave trade was abolished by decree on 26 October 1889; however, Noel-Buxton reported that Tajoura still remained a center of the slave trade, but \"limited to small though frequent shipments.\" While during the 1880s the port served as a distribution point for rifles and ammunition to Shewa and Ethiopia (during this period, Arthur Rimbaud lived in the city), Tajoura's importance inevitably declined with the construction of the Ethio-Djibouti Railways, which connected Djibouti with the hinterlands. The railway began to carry traffic on 22 July 1901, was extended to Dire Dawa 17 months later, and finally to Addis Ababa on 3 December 1929.\n\nDjibouti\nThe Djibouti government established various large-scale public works programmes to renovate the city. The Tadjoura port was modernized in 2000, at a cost of US $1.64 million. The work was described as part of the government's effort to help the economic development of the districts of Tadjourah, Obock, Ali Sabieh and Dikhil. The new Port of Tadjoura has been built to mainly focus on general cargo, such as livestock, sesame, frankincense, fertilizers and grain, at the cost of US $90 million. Initially the port has been developed in the aim to transport mainly potash from Ethiopia's Afar Region, while the mining is not yet developed. Besides that the port has a potential to provide for northern Djibouti and to its closest outlet for Ethiopia's Afar and Tigray regions. Compared with the traditional route from ports in Djibouti via Galafi, the new road (RN-11) from Tadjoura to Balho shortens the driving hour significantly.\n\nClimate\nFeaturing an arid climate, the town sees on average 186 mm (7.31 in) of rainfall per year. Average temperatures range from 26 °C (79 °F) in winter to 36 °C (97 °F) in summer.\n\nTransportation\nSea transport\nFrom Djibouti City to Tadjoura, it takes a two and a half hour ferry ride.\n\nLand transport\nThe distance between Djibouti City is 130 km.\n\nAir transport\nFor air transportation, Tajdoura is served by the Tadjoura Airport.  It takes 30 minutes to travel from Djibouti City to Tadjoura.\n\nSultans\nThe following is a list of sultans of Tadjoura:\n\n1620 Burhan bin Muhammad\n1630 Dini bin Muhammad\n1655 Kamil bin Burhan\n1655 Hamad bin Dini (or Muhammad bin Dini)\n1680 Musa bin Kamil\n1680 Dini bin Hamad (or Nasser bin Hamad)\n1705 Hamad bin Musa\n1705 Muhammad bin Dini\n1740 Muhammad bin Hamad\n1770 Hamad bin Naser\n1770 Hummad bin Muhammad\n1800-1820 Mandaytu bin Hamad\n1821-1859 Ad'allom Muhammad bin Hummad\n1860-9 Mar 1862 Muhammad bin Mandaytu\n1863-1879 Hummad bin Ad'allom Muhammad\n1880-24 Aug 1912 Hummad bin Muhammad\n2 Dec 1913-6 Aug 1927 Muhammad bin Arbahim\nDec 1928-21 Apr 1962 Hummad bin Muhammad bin Arbahim\n18 May 1964 – 1984 Habib bin Hummad bin Muhammad\n1985 - 17 May 2019 Abd'ul Kadir bin Hummad bin Muhammad bin Arbahim\n\nNotable people\nDileita Mohamed Dileita, Former Prime Minister of Djibouti\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nWorld Gazetteer entry on Tajurah at archive.today (archived 2013-02-09)\niTouchMap",

The sale is, however, contingent upon occupation. In 1887, Britain ceded sovereignty of the island to France while recognizing the French sphere of influence in the Gulf of Tadjoura, in exchange for the abandonment by France of any right in Zeila and the neighboring Sa'ad ad-Din Islands.\nIn 1900, a quarantine station was built to accommodate persons in health quarantine, but it was ultimately not used for lack of available medical personnel.\nThe islands were used by Henry de Monfreid in 1914 as a weapons cache to try to sell smuggled arms.

          "content": "Ali Sabieh (Somali: Cali Sabiix, Arabic: علي صبيح) is the second largest city in Djibouti. It is situated about 98 kilometres (61 miles) southwest of Djibouti City and 10 km (6 mi) north of the border with Ethiopia. It sprawls on a wide basin surrounded by granitic mountains on all sides. Ali Sabieh's mild climate makes it a popular tourist destination for Djiboutians. The landmark of Ali Sabieh mountain is located near the city.\n\nHistory\nAli Sabieh was a small village when the French created their French Somaliland. According to an old legend, the present-day territory of Ali Sabieh was covered by some trees, wadis, and a well. Nomads used to stop at the well for water on their way to the towns of Zeila or Harar, after signing the treaties in 1894 with the then-ruling Ugaas of Issa Somali, to establish a protectorate in the region referred to as French Somaliland. \nAli Sabieh became an administrative and commercial centre in the 19th century after the construction of the Ethio-Djibouti Railways, the first railway in French Somaliland. The railway reached this location on 14 July 1900. During this time, Ali Sabieh became the town that profited most from it and became a \"boom city,\" attracting most of the trade. In 1904, a report notes that \"when the border post of Ali Sabieh, it has the appearance of a fortress.\" Attached to the circle of \"Gobad-Dikkil\" from its inception in 1931, Ali Sabieh became the chief town of a circle autonomously 1939.\nDuring World War II, Italy's declaration of war on France and Great Britain came on 10 June 1940. The Italians undertook some offensive actions beginning on 18 June. From the Harrar Governorate, troops under General Guglielmo Nasi attacked the fort of Ali-Sabieh, and there was some skirmishing over the Ethio-Djibouti Railways. Between 1 and 10 July, several clashes with the Italians took place at Ali-Sabieh and along the railroad. On 10 July, when the government learned that the armistice was not yet put into effect in French Somaliland, President Philippe Pétain, a collaborationist government at Vichy, sent General Gaëtan Germain as his personal representative to correct the situation. Negotiations at Dewele, Italian East Africa on the local implementation of the armistice were finally completed on 8 August. With the Italian invasion of British Somaliland, the territory was completely surrounded on land by Italian possessions.\nThe Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland \"Pentagon\", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa, and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont surrendered and Colonel Raynal's troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle. It was briefly attached to the Circle of Djibouti from 1946 to 1949, then again to that circle of Gobad-Dikkil, 1952 to 1958, and to regain its own administration from 1958, but in 1967, it was transformed into districts.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 1977–1978 Ogaden War, Ali Sabieh, along with Dikhil, accommodated three quarters of the 8,000 Issa Somalis who had fled Ethiopia.\n\nOverview\nAli Sabieh is the capital of the Ali Sabieh Region. It lies along National Highway 5.\nNearby towns and villages include Dikhil (50 km), Arta (69 km), Ali Adde (22 km), Assamo (24 km), Dewele (18 km), Dasbiyo (15 km), Holhol (33 km), and Guelile (10 km). Public buses go from Djibouti City to Ali Sabieh. It takes two hours to get to Ali Sabieh. A contracted bus ride from Djibouti City to Ali Sabieh can charge between 700 Djiboutian franc. Ali Sabieh's central location has contributed to its economic revival. Goods travelling to other parts of Djibouti all depart from the city's outskirts.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2024 population census conducted by the Djiboutian national statistics authorities, Ali Sabieh has a total population of 44,782. It is the second-most populous city in Djibouti. The city inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups, with the Issa Somali predominant. The majority of Djibouti and Ali Sabieh's population is Muslim.\n\nSports\nFootball and basketball are the most popular sports in Ali Sabieh. One of the football fields has a capacity of 1,500 spectators. It is home to the Djibouti Super Football League's Ali Sabieh FC.\n\nEconomy\nAli Sabieh's economy today relies on tourism, agriculture, and a number of small factories, most of which are involved in the building trade. Mobile telephone communications are provided mainly by Djibouti Telecom, which has launched 3G and 4G services to their customers.\n\nEducation\nVarious primary schools and nurseries are located in Ali Sabieh. There are several state-run and privately owned secondary and high schools in the town. The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is typically French, Arabic, and emphasis on English as a second language.\n\nHealth\nAli Sabieh is the medical hub of the region of Ali Sabieh. Hospital Dr. Absieh is a key healthcare institution situated in Ali Sabieh. Its fundamental role in delivering essential medical services to the community makes it an indispensable asset for both residents and travelers alike. Public hospitals in Djibouti were first built in the late 1910s and continued to grow with public health initiatives.\n\nLandmarks\nThe town has many old quarters, with houses that are typically built with brown and black rocks, and mosques that are usually white-washed. Some have lost ground to more modern developments. For its famous landmark Ali Sabieh Mountain of national emblem of Djibouti symbol and for the Arrei Mountains highest point in Ali Sabieh region. The town hosts events to attract visitors to the town and its surroundings, including sporting events, shows, and singers.\n\nTransport\nAli Sabieh originally had a railway connection with Djibouti City and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with a picturesque French-style railway station located in the city centre, but this route has been abandoned. The new Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line. The most frequently used public vehicles in the town are auto rickshaws (tuk-tuk). They travel on a number of routes, serving nearly all of the town districts. Intercity bus services are also available, which connect Ali Sabieh to other major cities and towns across Djibouti, including Djibouti City, Dikhil, and Arta.\nPaved roads are available in Ali Sabieh, The vast majority of the roads were paved by the French during colonial rule. The local government has repaired some of the roads, but many others are still awaiting repair.\n\nGeography\nAli Sabieh is located in a valley in the southern section of the country. The city is situated in a mountainous area, in an enclosed valley of the highlands. It sits at an elevation of 756 metres (2,480 feet) above sea level. Ali Sabieh is a mountainous and hilly town. This altitude gives the settlement and the surrounding area a milder climate than the Djibouti City coastal area, where the weather is typically hot. The city's layout is partially scattered and irregular. Houses are generally single story and mostly made with cement. To the east of Ali Sabieh is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of wildlife to the area, including black-backed jackal, dorcas gazelle, Felis, caracal, various bird species, and the hamadryas baboon. The area attracts visitors looking for a moderate climate and pristine, scenic views.\n\nClimate\nAli Sabieh is characterized by a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh), with long, hot dry summers and mild winters. Ali Sabieh's climate is largely defined by its geographic location.\nThe summer season in Ali Sabieh is moderately long, characterized by hot and dry and refreshing breezes with little rain, but relative humidity is generally low, making the heat tolerable. Average high temperatures are between 32 °C (90 °F) and 37 °C (99 °F) during summer months, and it can sometimes rise up to 40 °C (104 °F) during heat waves, and it can occasionally drop to below 19 °C (66 °F) at night. Winter usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During the winter months, average low temperatures are between 15 °C (59 °F) and 16 °C (61 °F), and it can occasionally drop to below 12 °C (54 °F). There are two rainy seasons. The first rainy season extends from March to April, and the second from July to September. The average annual rainfall in Ali Sabieh is around 205 mm (8 in).\nElevation is a major factor in temperature levels. The highest recorded temperature was 40 °C or 104 °F on July 13, 2008, while the lowest recorded temperature was 12.5 °C or 54.5 °F on December 10, 1992.\n\nNotable people\nAden Robleh Awaleh: Politician and president of the National Democratic Party (PND).\nMahmoud Harbi: Politician\nHussein Ahmed Salah: Djiboutian long-distance runner\nAden Farah Samatar: Djiboutian musician\nMoumina Houssein Darar: Djiboutian Anti-Terrorism Police Investigator.\nAicha Bogoreh: First lady of Djibouti\nKadra Ahmed Hassan: Djibouti's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.\nNima Djama: Djiboutian musician\nAbdo Hamargod: Djiboutian musician\n\nSister towns\nSee also\n\nRailway stations in Djibouti\n\n\n== References ==",

Cependant l'altitude permet des températures moins élevées que sur le littoral, avec une température moyenne de 27,5 °C l'été et 17,5 °C l'hiver.\n\nTransports\nAli Sabieh est desservie par la route nationale 5 (frontière éthiopienne à Djibouti), qu'empruntent chaque heure des cars faisant les navettes avec la capitale, mais aussi par la ligne ferroviaire Djibouti - Dire Dawa - Addis-Abeba, ainsi que par le petit aéroport (code AITA : AII).\n\nToponymie\nAli Sabieh tient son nom de cali sabiix  .\nOn trouve parfois durant la période coloniale la graphie «Ali Sabiet».\n\nHistoire\nLa ville actuelle est créée en 1899, lors de l'installation au sommet d'une colline d'un poste militaire visant à protéger la construction du chemin de fer franco-éthiopien. Il est tenu par un détachement de militaires « soudanais » issus de la mission Marchand.\nAli Sabieh est rattaché au Cercle de Dikhil, en 1931, puis devient le chef-lieu d'un cercle distinct en 1939, avant d'être rattaché au Cercle de Djibouti, de 1946 à 1949, puis à nouveau à celui de Dikhil, de 1952 à 1958, et de retrouver une administration propre à partir de 1958.\nLa ville, comme l'ensemble de la colonie, a choisi la France de Vichy jusqu'à sa prise par les troupes la France libre en novembre 1942.\n\nPolitique et administration\nLes plus illustres figures du paysage politique et artistique de la République tirent leurs origines de la ville d’Ali Sabieh et de ses localités environnantes. Parmi ces éminentes personnalités, figurent notamment Mahamoud Harbi Farah, Idriss Farah Abaneh, Aden Robleh Awaleh et Ahmed Goumaneh, tous acteurs majeurs de l’histoire politique nationale.\nIls demeurent, aujourd’hui encore, parmi les figures les plus emblématiques de la région, aux côtés d’artistes engagés tels que Nima Djama, Fourchette, et Abdi Guedi, dit \"BawBaw\", dont l’expression artistique fut profondément ancrée dans le combat pour l’indépendance de Djibouti. Ensemble, ces hommes et ces femmes ont façonné, par leur engagement et leur talent, une part essentielle de la mémoire collective et de l’identité nationale.\n\nListe des maires d Ali Sabieh\nJumelages\nWillits (États-Unis)\n Pocatello (États-Unis)\n Kamloops (Canada)\n Vicuña (Chili)\n Safi (Maroc)\n Narrogin (Australie)\n Bayburt (Turquie)\n\nPopulation et société\nDémographie\nLe peuplement d'Ali Sabieh résulte en partie de trois grandes vagues de réfugiés politiques somaliens, motivée par le massacre d'Aichaa, en 1963, la guerre de l'Ogaden en 1977-78, et le renversement de Mohamed Siad Barre, en 1991, ainsi que d'une quatrième vague de réfugiés climatiques, issus des régions d'Aichaa et d'Hadagalah, motivée par la grande sécheresse de 1984.[réf. nécessaire]\nEn 2012, la population d'Ali Sabieh est estimée à 71 230 habitants, ce qui en fait la deuxième plus grande ville de la République de Djibouti, derrière Djibouti, la capitale.\n\nÉducation\nSanté\nAli Sabieh possède un hôpital, il accueille entre autres la population de la ville d'Ali-Sabieh ainsi que celle de la région en cas d'urgence. En 2011 le gouvernement de Djibouti a trouvé un accord avec la BID (Banque islamique pour le développement) un accorde d'un prêt de 13,5 millions de dollars américains pour la construction d'un hôpital régional à Ali-Sabieh\n\nSport et loisirs\nLa ville d'Ali-Sabieh possède un club portant le son nom : le AS Ali-sabieh(Asas/Djibouti Telecom). Réputé, il est considéré actuellement comme le meilleur club du pays et un des meilleurs de l'histoire.

Lying east of Lake Abbe,  It is situated about 122 km (76 mi) southwest of Djibouti City and 12 km (7.5 mi) north of the border with Ethiopia. It serves as the administrative centre of the Dikhil Region, and is home to the Afar and Somali ethnic groups. The town develops gardens and fruit trees.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nIn 1986, the survey work sites were performed by R. Joussaume and researchers ISERST. The engravings oldest discovered to date are from the fourth or third millennium BC, the most famous is the site of Handoga near Dikhil where the ruins of a village squares sub circular dry stone delivered different objects. Including ceramic shards matching vases used brazier, or containers that can hold water, several choppers and microliths, blades, drills, trenchers basalt, rhyolite or obsidian. Also a pearl orange coralline, three glass paste, etc.. There were no trace of metal object.\n\nFrench Somaliland\nThe village was originally built around the well of Harrou near a wadi, with houses constructed of mud and stone, the Afar and Issa were the founders of Dikhil. As the village continued to grow after the established of the French Somaliland. Most of the inhabitants earned their living through animal husbandry and commerce, and used a well for drinking water. In December 1927, the French colonial authorities sent a military detachment to reconnoiter the region, in order to prepare the installation of a defense post, intended to secure the borders of the French Somaliland. The first administrative division of the territory, in 1914, defined two zones besides the city of Djibouti: the districts \"Dankali\" and \"Issa\". With the occupation of the territory at the end of the 1920s, the district circles of \"Tadjoura\" and \"Gobad-Dikhil\" are created, in 1930, became the capital of a new administrative district, called the Circle of Dikhil. When Wilfred Thesiger visited Dikhil in May 1934, he was struck by \"a most impregnable fort here\" recently constructed by the French colonial authorities. \"The walls are twenty feet high, loop-holed, and topped with broken glass and a barbed-wire entanglement. There are two large observation towers.\" He believed that garrison stationed there provided its only economic support, for had \"the site any real value it would have been used before this by the natives. On January 17, 1935, Albert Bernard was a colonial administrative student, learned that an Assaïamara raid had looted camps and returned to the west to Ethiopia. He left accompanied by fifteen or seventeen troops to intercept him. On the morning of the 18th, near Môdathou, south of Lake Abbe, he led an attack against the group, but his troops, although better equipped, were overwhelmed by the number. Albert Bernard is killed, probably cut his throat, as well as all the troops except two. In 1933, an airstrip was built and, three years later, in 1936, Ali Sabieh's road was extended to Djibouti. An elementary school was established in the village in 1940s, and there were several shops. During World War II, Italy's declaration of war on France and Great Britain came on 10 June 1940. The Italians did undertake some offensive actions beginning on 18 June. From Harrar Governorate, troops under General Guglielmo Nasi to attack French Somaliland, there was some skirmishes. When the government on 10 July learned that the armistice was not yet put into effect in French Somaliland, President Philippe Pétain a collaborationist government at Vichy sent General Gaëtan Germain as his personal representative to correct the situation. Negotiations at Dewele, Italian East Africa on the local implementation of the armistice were only finally completed on 8 August. The Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland \"Pentagon\", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont surrendered and Colonel Raynal's troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle. A local battalion from French Somaliland participated in the Liberation of Paris in 1944. During the 1970s, the Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast (FLCS), who attacked the French personnel who were patrolling the area.\n\nDjibouti\nA third independence referendum was held in the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas on 8 May 1977. The previous referendums were held in 1958 and 1967, which rejected independence. This referendum backed independence from France. A landslide 98.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from France, officially marking Djibouti's independence. Following the conclusion of the 1977-1978 Ogaden War, Dikhil along with Ali Sabieh accommodated three quarters of the 8,000 Issas who had fled from Ethiopia. In 1979, the first President of independent Djibouti Hassan Gouled Aptidon in Dikhil the party founded the People's Rally for Progress, which has since dominated the politics of Djibouti, its led by President Ismail Omar Guelleh and is in a coalition government with Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) and other parties.\n\nOverview\nDikhil is connected to other environs by RN-1 National Highway. Public buses go from Djibouti City to Dikhil. It takes three hour to get to Dikhil. A contracted bus ride from Djibouti city to Dikhil can charge between 750 Djiboutian franc.\nThis is a summer tourist destination for Djibouti thanks to its healthy climate and its location on the road to Lake Abbe. Dikhil is located 12 kilometers from the Ethiopian border and approximately 100 kilometers beyond Djibouti City. It is a population center for the South west area, a frontier town with about 54,000 people.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2024 census, the population of Dikhil was at 27,378. The town inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups, but the Afar and the Issa Somali are predominant.\n\nTransport\nAs an inland area, Dikhil's transportation system is largely road-based. For air transportation, the city is served by the Dikhil Airport.\n\nEconomy\nDikhil is one of Djibouti's main agricultural areas, with the local economy largely centered around farming. The town serves as a commercial transit point for goods between Djibouti City and Ethiopia. The city was visited by more than 6,000 tourists over the years. Ethiopian trucks and traders frequently pass through the town.\n\nClimate\nDikhil is situated on a spur of a plateau in the Okarre Mountains.\nDikhil has a hot arid climate (Köppen: BWh) with hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters. However, due to the town's altitude and inland location, its climate features are the humidity is very low, and temperatures usually fall on 28 °C (82 °F) at night, which makes summer particularly pleasant compared to coastal cities. The rainy season extends from July to October. From November to February, the town experiences the mild winter season. It heats up from June to October, though the nights are pleasant. This elevation gives the settlement and the surrounding area a milder climate than the Djibouti city coastal area, where the weather is typically hot.\n\nNotable people\nDaher Ahmed Farah, Djiboutian politician\nOugoureh Kifleh Ahmed, Djiboutian politician\n\nSister towns\nReferences\nWorks cited\nImbert-Vier, Simon (2008).

C'est une ville historique Afar.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nDikhil se situe dans le sud-est de la région de Dikhil et l'ouest de la république de Djibouti, à une centaine de kilomètres de Djibouti, la capitale, et une dizaine de kilomètres de l'Éthiopie.\n\nHydrographie\nDikhil est traversée par l'oued Chekkeyti, qui draine les plateaux d'Oukoula et s'écoule, au nord, vers le graben de Hanlé.\n\nGéologie et relief\nDikhil se situe à une altitude moyenne de 507 m, dans une dépression, cernée de collines.\nLa formation géologique de Dikhil se compose en surface de conglomérats (roches détritiques et sédiments lacustres), ainsi que d'argile, de gypse,  de diatomite et de limon graveleux, dans les strates inférieures.\n\nClimat\nLe climat de Dikhil est de type tropical aride, avec une température moyenne annuelle de 26 °C et seulement 187 mm de précipitations, concentrées sur les mois d'août à novembre.\nCependant, l'altitude permet d'obtenir, outre un faible taux d'humidité, des températures plus agréables que sur le littoral, s'élevant, en moyenne, à 30 °C l'été et à 17 °C l'hiver, avec toutefois de fortes variations entre le jour et la nuit.\n\nTransports\nLa Nationale 1, reliant Galafi (frontière éthiopienne) à Djibouti, est l'unique route goudronnée desservant Dikhil.\nLa ville possède, par ailleurs, un petit aéroport et des cars assurent quotidiennement la liaison avec la capitale.\n\nHistoire\nLa découverte d'objets dont des récipients en céramique et en verre, et des outils en basalte, par Roger Joussaume et ses collègues de l'Institut supérieur d'études et de recherches scientifiques et techniques (ISERTS), notamment à Handoga Dikhil, en 1986, fait remonter l'occupation du site au troisième ou quatrième millénaire avant notre ère.\nSiège du sultanat Afar de Goba'ad, Dikhil est une ville historique importante dans la région. Le sultan Hummad Lo’oyta signa le 11 mars 1862 le  premier traité d’amitié qui le liait à la France.\nLoïta fut le second sultan après son père Arbâhim Gôna. Une série de successions eut lieu en cette période mais le fils cadet Hummad Lo’oyta donna sa forme décisive à l’État des Debnés qui était autrefois rattaché au sultanat de Tadjourah et Rehayto 'Obock', ils auront une forme d'indépendance. \nLe sultan Hummad Lo’oyta est conscient que les français et autres colons affluent pour annexer leurs territoires mais pour ce sultan Afar qui représente à la fois les afars et quelques trius issas.\nL’ancienne capitale d’Obock devenue nuisible à la France du fait de la résistance des populations locales Afars, Obock est abandonnée grâce à la diplomatie qu’use le sultan Hummad Lo’oyta en signant le traité d’Ambado le 14 décembre 1885 à Obock et permettant ainsi à la France de s’installer dans le sud du pays.\nCe traité qui, bien évidemment sera complété  par le second traité d’Ambado signé par les chefs Issas en 1885. \nAu décès du Sultan Houmed Loïta, le fils Ahmed La ’dé succède à son père jusqu’en 1903 et meurt prématurément. Ce dernier est l’artisan de la signature des traités avec les Italiens avec lesquels Houmed Loïta signe deux traités mais qui seront niés lorsque les tensions entre les deux puissances coloniales vont s’affronter dans une bataille diplomatique. Ahmed La ‘dé est un fervent artisan de l’indépendance du Sultanat de Gobaad en particulier, et des Sultanats afars en général vis-à-vis du pouvoir colonial. C’est pourquoi il ne lésine pas sur l’affaire du sel d’Assal et déclare à côté de son père que le lac Assal est bel et bien une propriété collective du peuple afar. Nous sommes ainsi vers les années 1900 et 1910 lorsque Hanfaré Loita lances des grands raids dans le sud en menaçant directement la ville de Djibouti (Hol-Hol, Taabiya, etc) réprimés par l’administration coloniale française. C’est pourquoi le désarmement des debnés devient un des impératifs du colon français. Un rapport  écrit à Obock, retrouvé dans les archives par Ougoureh Hassan, stipule clairement que l’hégémonie des princes Arbahintos est une menace pour la présence française. Le Nord est désarmé dès les années 1920 et 1930 après ces troubles. Quant au sud, la situation est difficile pour le colon qui s’avoue vaincu. Il suffit juste de lire Alphonse Lippmann dans « Guerriers et sorciers en Somalie » que Dikhil est interdit à tout français aventurier et administrateur. C’est considéré comme une zone de tous les dangers. \nEn 1930, au refus d’obtempérer aux consignes de l’administration française et d’Hassan Dîma, Hajji Ali et Loita le cadet, sultan de Gobaad, sont arrêtés avant d’être déportés à Fort-Dauphin au Madagascar avec Mohamed V, roi du Maroc, le père d’Ali Abdi Farah « Abdi Awar » et le vizir Houmed de Tadjourah. Le sultan Loita y meurt dès 1932.. Les debnés livrent une bataille contre Alphonse Lippmann à Uxukya. C’est dernier affrontement entre les Debnés et la France.\nle sultanat ancestrale Afar de Goba'ad qui a pour fief Dikhil et sa région, est le lieu de rencontre de différents traités et alliances qui formeront la configuration actuelle moderne de la république de Djibouti.\n\nLes différents sultants Afar de Goba'ad 'région de Dikhil'\nHamad Arbahim (XVIII-1801, mort en somalie)\nLoita lu (1792-1860, mort à Tadjourah)\nHoumed (1832-13 octobre 1902 à Dorra)\nHamad La'de (1860-1903, mort à obock)\nHanfaré Le Grand (1842-1920, mort à Tadjourah)\nLoita Le Grand (1858-1907, mort à Harar)\nLoita Le Petit (1880-1932, mort à Madagascar)\nMahammad fils de Sayta (1889-1935, mort à Gobaad)\nArbahim Balala (1880-1963, mort à Gobaad)\nHoumed Loita II (1899-25 Avril 1963, mort à Gobaad)\nMahammad Loita dit Boko (1905-1981, mort à Gobaad)\nHassan Boko (1932-2002, mort à Gobaad)\nAli Boko (1934-2013, mort à Djibouti)\nHabib Boko (Actuel sultan de Gobaad)\n\nPériode coloniale\nEn décembre 1927, les autorités coloniales françaises envoient un détachement militaire en reconnaissance, afin de préparer l'installation d'un poste de défense, destiné à sécuriser les frontières de la côte française des Somalis. Le poste est fondé le 26 mars 1928 et un fort est édifié.\nIl est tenu par une milice de recrutement local sous le commandement d'un officier français, soutenue par une section de tirailleurs sénégalais, à partir de 1933.\nLa ville se développe en contrebas du fort, dans la plaine, près de la palmeraie, toujours existante, et, en 1930, devient le chef-lieu d'une nouvelle circonscription administrative, appelée Cercle de Dikhil. En 1933, une piste d'aviation est aménagée et, trois ans plus tard, en 1936, la route d'Ali Sabieh est prolongée jusqu'à Djibouti.\nLe 18 janvier 1935, au lieu-dit de Moraito, Albert Bernard, commandant du cercle, et une quinzaine de miliciens trouvent la mort en affrontant un groupe assaïamara qui retournait vers l'Éthiopie après un raid de prédation.

          "content": "Obock (also Obok, Arabic: أبخ, Hayyú) is a small port town in Djibouti. It is located on the Northern shore of the Gulf of Tadjoura, where it opens out into the Gulf of Aden.  The town is home to an airstrip and has ferries to Djibouti City. The French form Obock derives from Arabic \"Oboh\", which is a deformation of Oboki, a name given to a local wadi.\n\nHistory\nThe fishing village was originally built on the plateau of Dala-h Húgub near the Dar'i Wadi, with some houses constructed of mud and stone and Daboyta. Most of the inhabitants made their living through animal husbandry, fishing, commerce and used a well for drinking water. During the Middle Ages, Obock was ruled by the Ifat Sultanate and then the Adal Sultanate. The Sultans of Raheita emerged from the Adal Sultanate. Although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire since 1554, between 1821 and 1841, Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, came to control Yemen and modern-day Eritrea, and claims on Ethiopia as far as Harar. In 1884, the commander of the patrol sloop L’Inferent, a French ship, confirmed the Egyptian presence in the area around Obock. The commander of the patrol sloop Le Vaudreuil also reported that the Egyptians were occupying the interior between Obock and Tadjoura. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years before the Egyptian garrison was withdrawn from the area in 1862,\n\nFrench Somaliland\nDuring the Scramble for Africa, growing French interest in the area took place against a backdrop of British activity in Egypt and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Between 1883 and 1887, France signed various treaties with the then ruling Somali and Afar Sultans, which allowed it to expand the protectorate to include the Gulf of Tadjoura. Obock was originally significant as the site of the first French colony in the region, established by treaty with the local Afar rulers on March 11, 1862. The French were interested in having a coaling station for steamships, which would become especially important upon the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. (Up to that time French ships had to buy coal at the British port of Aden across the gulf, an unwise dependency in case of war.) \n\nThe site was not the subject of any occupation, just visited by the ships of the naval divisions assigned to the Indian Ocean, until the installation of trader Pierre Arnoux in 1881, followed by Paul Soleillet. Obock became a true colony in 1884 with the arrival in August of Léonce Lagarde, who established an administration and extended French possession in the Gulf of Tadjoura, forming the Territory of Obock and outbuildings, with Obock as its capital. By 1885, Obock had 800 inhabitants and a school. However, the anchorage was more exposed than the site of Djibouti on the south side of the Gulf of Tadjoura, and the colonial administration moved there in 1894. The population of Obock subsequently declined. \n\n However, until the French occupation of Tadjoura in 1927, Obock remained the only place on the northern coast of the Gulf of Tadjoura with a colonial administrative office. It became the capital of the Dankali District in 1914, then an administrative position from 1927 which was subsumed into the \"Circle of Adaels\" in 1929. During World War II, Italy's declaration of war on France and Great Britain came on 10 June 1940, with them undertaking some offensive actions beginning on 18 June. From Harrar Governorate, troops under General Guglielmo Nasi to attack French Somaliland, there was some skirmishes. When the government on 10 July learned that the armistice was not yet put into effect in French Somaliland, President Philippe Pétain a collaborationist government at Vichy sent General Gaëtan Germain as his personal representative to correct the situation. Negotiations at Dewele, Italian East Africa on the local implementation of the armistice were only finally completed on 8 August. By that time, the British offensive against the Italians had tightened the blockade of French Somaliland. Famine set in malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children and many townsfolk left for the hinterland. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. Obock became the capital of a circle responsible for resupplying the colony during the Allied blockade from 1941 to 1943. Only a few Arab dhows (boutres) managed to run the blockade to Djibouti and Obock and only two French ships from Madagascar managed to run it. The Japanese declaration of war (7 December 1941) gave the colony some respite, since the British were forced to withdraw all but two ships from the blockade for use in the Far East. The Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland \"Pentagon\", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont surrendered and Colonel Raynal's troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle. A local battalion from French Somaliland participated in the Liberation of Paris in 1944. In 1963, Obock's circle was created by division of that of Tadjourah region.\n\nDjibouti\nA third independence referendum was held in the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas on 8 May 1977. The previous referendums were held in 1958 and 1967, which rejected independence. This referendum backed independence from France. A landslide 98.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from France, officially marking Djibouti's independence. Obock is expected to be the site of the Chinese naval base in Djibouti.\nObock has become a key stop in the route for illegal migration from Ethiopia to Saudi Arabia, being the location from where smugglers take migrants on boats to Yemen.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2024 census, the population of Obock was at 20,152. The town inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups. The Afar and Issa Somali, are predominant.\n\nPostage stamps\nDuring its time as a French colony, Obock issued its own postage stamps; for more detail see Postage stamps and postal history of Obock.\n\nOverview\nObock is connected to other environs by RN-14 National Highway.  A ferry ride from Djibouti City to Obock takes three hours; the distance is 237 km (147 mi).\n\nClimate and geography\nObock has a dry climate. It is classified as hot and semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSh). Obock is 13 m above sea level on the plateau of Gazelles (\"Dala-h Húgub in Afar\") in desert terrain. The sky is always clear and bright throughout the year.\n\nThe submarine coastal spring waters have an interesting geothermal potential (with a deep temperature of approximatively 200 °C).\n\nNotable residents\nHasna Mohamed Dato, Politician\nAbdallah Mohamed Kamil, Politician\nHenry de Monfreid, Adventurer, writer\n\nReferences\nWorks cited\nImbert-Vier, Simon (2008).

          "content": "Obock (ou Hayyú en afar) est une ville littorale de la république de Djibouti, et le chef-lieu du district et de la région du même nom. C'est une ville historique Afar .\n\nHistoire\nXIXe siècle\nEn 1858, un notable propose au consul de France à Aden, Henri Lambert, l'achat par la France d'Obock, alors pratiquement inhabité. Mais Lambert est assassiné le 4 juin 1859. Une mission navale française arrête les suspects, et organise l'envoi en France de plusieurs notables qui signent le 11 mars 1862 avec Édouard Thouvenel, ministre des affaires étrangères, un traité de paix et d'amitié perpétuelle par lequel la France achète « les ports, rade et mouillage d’Obock situés près du cap Ras Bir avec la plaine qui s’étend depuis Ras Aly au sud jusqu’à Ras Doumeirah au nord » pour 10 000 thalers (55 000 francs de l'époque). Le 20 mai suivant a lieu la prise de possession officielle du territoire par le capitaine de frégate Buret du Curieux, qui note dans son rapport au ministre de la Marine qu'il avait la conviction que si les habitants de cette côte désiraient la présence des Français, « c'est qu'ils étaient persuadés que nous étions indifférents au commerce des esclaves et que nous autoriserions leurs boutres à porter le pavillon français pour couvrir leur commerce illicite ». \n\nPendant près de 20 ans, le site ne fait l'objet d'aucune occupation, même après l'ouverture du canal de Suez. Il est simplement visité par des navires de la division navale de l'océan Indien, jusqu'à l'installation du commerçant Pierre Arnoux en 1881, suivi de Paul Soleillet, qui doivent exercer leurs activités dans l'insécurité chronique qui résulte de l'absence de tout gouvernement sur ce territoire théoriquement français . Dans la foulée de la guerre franco-chinoise au cours de laquelle la Grande-Bretagne, neutre, interdit la relâche des navires de guerre français à Aden, le gouvernement français se décide enfin à créer une escale de ravitaillement sur la route de l'Extrême-Orient et de Madagascar. Obock est occupé en 1884, avec l'arrivée en août de Léonce Lagarde qui y établit une administration et étend rapidement la souveraineté française dans le golfe de Tadjourah, formant ainsi le territoire d'Obock et dépendances.\nPlusieurs autres négociants s'installent à Obock. En 1886 on y crée un dépôt de condamnés aux travaux forcés pour condamnés arabes, puis africains, indiens et annamites. Le pénitencier, qui n'existera que peu d'années, est installé dans les bâtiments de l'établissement de Paul Soleillet, déserté après son décès. Les détenus exécutent des travaux d'utilité publique tels qu'une digue, un quai, des jardins et la résidence du gouverneur. \nLagarde constate rapidement qu'Obock offre peu de possibilités d'expansion économique car la route vers le Choa et le reste de l'Éthiopie traverse des régions hostiles; en outre le mouillage y est exposé. Le lieu est remplacé dans ses fonctions portuaires et administratives par la ville de Djibouti, créée en 1888, et son territoire est intégré à la côte française des Somalis, à sa création le 20 mai 1896. L'un après l'autre, les négociants et les maisons de commerce désertent Obock pour le nouveau chef-lieu de la colonie.\nObock est le débouché d'un câble télégraphique sous-marin qui relie la colonie française à Aden via l'île de Périm, construit par la société Eastern Telegraph Company (autorisée en 1889 pour une concession de vingt ans).\n\nXXe siècle\nSa situation géographique est aussi utilisée pour la contrebande d'armes, activité répandue dans le golfe d'Aden et en Somalie et contre laquelle le gouvernement français s'engage en 1909 aux côtés du Royaume-Uni et de l'Italie.\n\nObock demeure néanmoins, jusqu'à l'occupation de Tadjourah en 1927, le seul lieu de la côte septentrionale du golfe de Tadjourah doté d'une administration coloniale. Elle devient le chef-lieu du district dankali en 1914, puis un poste administratif en 1927. Il disparaît lors de son intégration dans le cercle des Adaels en 1929, mais le redevient dès 1931. Obock est chef-lieu d'un cercle chargé de ravitailler la colonie lors du blocus allié, de 1941 à 1943, puis de nouveau un simple poste administratif, avant de redevenir un chef-lieu de cercle de 1963 à l'indépendance, en 1977.\n\nBase militaire américaine puis chinoise\nUne base militaire des États-Unis y était installée brièvement avant de rejoindre le camp Lemonnier, camp de la Légion Étrangère.\nEn 2015, la Chine prend la place des Américains. Des projets d'aménagement du territoire sont présentés, comportant notamment des infrastructures portuaire et aéroportuaire auxquels les institutions financières et des sociétés chinoises ont prévu d'apporter leur concours. \nEn janvier 2016, le chantier sur un terrain de 90 acres, soit environ 0,36 km2, commencent comportant entre autres la construction d'une nouvelle jetée et d'un terminal conteneur.\nLe porte-paroles du ministère chinois de la Défense a confirmé, dans la conférence de presse du 25 février 2016, que la construction des « infrastructures de soutien logistique » a commencé à Djibouti. Les travaux devraient prendre fin d’ici 2017 selon les observateurs.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nObock se situe dans le sud de la région, à l'est de la côte septentrionale du golfe de Tadjourah, au porte du Detroit de Bab el Mandeb et dans la partie nord-est de la république de Djibouti, à 235 km (par route) de Djibouti, la capitale.\n\nHydrographie\nGéologie et relief\nObock se situe à 13 m d'altitude sur le plateau des Gazelles (Dála-h Húgub, en afar), en terrain désertique.\nMangrove de Godoria, de Ras Siyan et de Hargayya.\nMassif de Mabla.\nLe fond marin de la mer d'Obock est riche en poisson.\n\nClimat\nLe climat d'Obock est de type tropical aride avec une température moyenne annuelle de 26,5 °C et un total de 80 mm de précipitations par an.\n\nTransports\nObock est desservie par les nationales 14 (Obock-Tadjourah) et 15 (Obock-frontière érythréenne) et par un aéroport.\nPar ailleurs, des ferries la relient quotidiennement à Djibouti, la capitale.\n\nToponymie\nLa forme française Obock dérive de l'arabe Oboh, déformation d'Obóki, nom donné à l'oued Dár'i dans sa partie moyenne, en amont de son delta côtier.\n\nPolitique et administration\nListe des maires d'Obock\nMohamed Omar;\nSalem Abdallah Youssouf ;\nDini Mohamed Bourhan;\nIsmael Ali Yabeh;\nAbdourazak Daoud Ahmed;\nOmar Farada;\nAhmed Abdallah Dagueh;\nHassan Dabaleh;\nAbdoulmalik mohamed banoita\n\nJumelages\nObock est jumelée à deux villes :\n\n Zeilah (Somaliland)\n Hadiboh (Yémen)\n\nPopulation et société\nDémographie\nEn 2019, la population d'Obock est estimée à 9 200 habitants, ce qui en fait la quatrième ville la plus peuplée de la République de Djibouti, derrière Djibouti, Ali Sabieh et Tadjourah.\n\nÉducation\nObock dispose de deux écoles primaires, d'un lycée général et d'un lycée technique.\n\nSanté\nObock dispose d'un hôpital.\n\nSport et loisirs\nÉconomie\nPort d'Obock\n\nCulture et patrimoine\nLieux et monuments\nMaisons coloniales dont :\nMaison de Léonce Lagarde;\nMaison d'Arthur Rimbaud, aujourd'hui musée;\nMaison d'Henry de Monfreid, aujourd'hui école;\nSources thermales et fumerolles;\nPlage et tombant\nLes îles des Sept Frères\nLe Phare de Ras Bir\nSans oublier les monts Mabla, à 25 km à l'ouest d'Obock.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la ville\nDini Ahmed Abou Baker, signataire du traité de cession de 1862 ;\nLouis-Barthélémy Denis de Rivoyre (1937-1927), explorateur ;\nHasna Mohamed Dato (1959-), femme politique djiboutienne, née à Obock ;\nAhmed Dini (1932-2004), premier premier ministre de la République de Djibouti ;\nMohammed Hamed, sultan de Raheita en 1862 ;\nLéonce Lagarde (1860-1936), administrateur (1883) puis premier commandant (1884-1887) et gouverneur (1887-1899) d'Obock ;\nHenri Lambert (1828-1859), explorateur commerçant à La Réunion, ancien agent consulaire à Aden ayant négocié le traité de cession en 1859 ;\nHenry de Monfreid (1879-1974), navigateur, trafiquant, écrivain : il a vécu à Obock de 1915 jusqu'au milieu des années 1920 ;\nPoindi Pacili (̠1888), chef kanak exilé ;\nArthur Rimbaud (1854-1891), poète et trafiquant d'armes : dans la première moitié des années 1880, il fait de brefs séjours dans ce qu'il appelle «cette affreuse colonie».\n\nNotes et références\nArticles connexes\nHistoire de Djibouti\nTerritoire d'Obock\nRégion d'Obock\nSecond empire colonial français\n Portail de Djibouti",
