The island is part of the Djibouti Region; the island has a total population of about 20 inhabitants, which increases considerably during the summer.\nThe island was occupied by Great Britain from 1840 to 1887.\n\nHistory\nIn August 1840, the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and commerce between the Sultan Mohammed bin Mohammed of Tadjoura and Commander Robert Moresby of the Indian Navy describes the sale of Moucha Island to Great Britain for ten sacks of rice. The sale is, however, contingent upon occupation. In 1887, Britain ceded sovereignty of the island to France while recognizing the French sphere of influence in the Gulf of Tadjoura, in exchange for the abandonment by France of any right in Zeila and the neighboring Sa'ad ad-Din Islands.\nIn 1900, a quarantine station was built to accommodate persons in health quarantine, but it was ultimately not used for lack of available medical personnel.\nThe islands were used by Henry de Monfreid in 1914 as a weapons cache to try to sell smuggled arms. After the deposit was discovered, a \"detachment indigenous guards\" was installed on the island and occupancy restricted. This monitoring station was removed in May 1915.\n\nPhysical geography\nMoucha Island is the largest island in Djibouti. Less than 3 km long, Moucha Island's mainland is surrounded by the smaller Maskali Islands, a few islets and a coral reef. It lies approximately 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of the Djibouti's mainland\n\nClimate\nIt enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. Featuring an arid climate (Köppen: BWh), temperatures range from very warm during the months of December, January and February, to extremely hot in July. There are two seasons: a summer dry season from May to October and a relatively cool season from November to April (winter).\n\nGallery of photos\nEconomy\nThe economy of Moucha is predominantly based on services and tourism. Moucha Island is one of the popular holiday destinations in Djibouti. Musha, the main city on the island, is served by the Moucha Airport. All of these islands, sometimes collectively referred to as Moucha Islands, are well-known diving sites.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "content": "## Overview\nMoucha Island is a coral island in the Gulf of Tadjoura, just off the shores of Djibouti. Its total length is no more than 3 km, and it is surrounded by Maskali Island, a group of tiny islands and a coral reef. Together, these are sometimes called the Moucha Islands and are known for their diving opportunities, as well as for swimming, snorkelling and fishing.\n\n## Get in\nIt's about a 30 to 45 minute boat ride to the islands from the Port of Djibouti. Many visitors head to the island with a small private or chartered boat, but there is also a ferry connection from the Port. The fare shouldn't be more than a couple francs.\n\n## Get around\nAs the islands are small and mostly undeveloped, the way to get around is by foot.\n\n## Eat\nAs the islands are a rather popular day trip for Djibouti middle class, a few outdoor places to eat and drink are usually available.\n\n## Sleep\nThere aren't really any sleeping facilities available, but it is not unusual for visitors to bring some camping stuff and stay on the islands overnight.",
