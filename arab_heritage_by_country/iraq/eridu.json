      "content": "Eridu (Sumerian: 𒉣𒆠, romanized: NUN.KI; Sumerian: eridugki; Akkadian: irîtu) was a Sumerian city located at Tell Abu Shahrain (Arabic: تل أبو شهرين), also Abu Shahrein or Tell Abu Shahrayn, an archaeological site in Lower Mesopotamia. It is located in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq, near the modern city of Basra. Eridu is traditionally considered the earliest city in southern Mesopotamia based on the Sumerian King List. Located 24 kilometers south-southwest of the ancient site of Ur, Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of Sumerian cities that grew around temples, almost in sight of one another. The city gods of Eridu were Enki and his consort Damkina. Enki, later known as Ea, was considered to have founded the city. His temple was called E-Abzu, as Enki was believed to live in Abzu, an aquifer from which all life was thought to stem. According to Sumerian temple hymns, another name for the temple of Ea/Enki was called Esira (Esirra).\n\n\"... The temple is constructed with gold and lapis lazuli, Its foundation on the nether-sea (apsu) is filled in. By the river of Sippar (Euphrates) it stands. O Apsu pure place of propriety, Esira, may thy king stand within thee. ...\"\nAt nearby Ur there was a temple of Ishtar of Eridu (built by Lagash's ruler Ur-Baba) and a sanctuary of Inanna of Eridu (built by Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu). Ur-Nammu also recorded building a temple of Ishtar of Eridu at Ur which is assumed to have been a rebuild.\nOne of the religious quarters of Babylon, containing the temple called the Esagila as well as the temple of Annunitum, among others, was also named Eridu.\n\nArchaeology\nEridu is located on a natural hill in a basin approximately 15 miles long and 20 feet deep, which is separated from the Euphrates by a sandstone ridge called the Hazem. This basin, the As Sulaybiyat Depression (formerly: Khor en-Nejeif), becomes a seasonal lake (Arabic: Sebkha) during the rainy season from November to April.  During this period, it is filled by the discharge of the Wadi Khanega.  Adjacent to eastern edge of the seasonal lake are the Hammar Marshes.\nIn the 3rd Millennium BC a canal, Id-edin-Eriduga (NUN)ki \"the  canal  of  the  Eridug  plain\", connected Eridu to the Euphrates river, which later shifted its course. The path of the canal is marked by several low tells with 2nd Millennium BC surface pottery and later burials.\nThe site contains 8 mounds:\n\nMound 1 - Abū Šahrain, 580 meters x 540 meters in area NW to WE, 25 meters in height, Enki Temple,  Ur III Ziggurat (É-u₆-nir) Sacred Area, Early Dynastic plano-convex bricks found, Ubaid Period cemetery\nMound 2 – 350 meters x 350 meters in area, 4.3 meters in height, 1 kilometer N of Abū Šahrain, Early Dynastic Palace, remnants of city wall built with plano-convex bricks\nMound 3 - 300 × 150 meters in area, 2.5 meters high, 2.2 kilometers SSW of Abū Šahrain, Isin-Larsa pottery found\nMound 4 - 600 × 300 meters in area, 2.5 kilometers SW of Abū Šahrain, Kassite pottery found\nMound 5 - 500 × 300 meters in area, 3 meters high, 1.5 kilometers SE of Abū Šahrain, Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods\nMound 6 - 300 × 200 meters in area, 2 meters high, 2.5 kilometers SW of Abū Šahrain\nMound 7 - 400 × 200 meters in area, 1.5 meters high, 3 kilometers E of Abū Šahrai\nMound 8 - Usalla, flat area, 8 kilometers NW of Abū Šahrain, Hajj Mohammed and later Ubaid\n\nThe site was initially excavated by John George Taylor, the British Vice-counsel at Basra, in 1855. Among the finds were inscribed bricks enabling the identification of the site as Eridu. Excavation on the main tell next occurred by R. Campbell Thompson from April 10 until May 8 in 1918, and H. R. Hall from April 21 until May 8 in 1919, who also conducted a survey in the area around the tell. An interesting find by Hall was a piece of manufactured blue glass which he dated to c. 2000 BC. The blue color was achieved with cobalt, long before this technique emerged in Egypt.\nThis lump of glass is currently dated to the twenty-first century BC or even earlier, and is considered as perhaps the earliest such glass object in the world in the History of glass. It was produced during the Akkadian Empire or the early Ur III period.\n\nExcavation there resumed from 1946 to 1949 under Fuad Safar and Seton Lloyd of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities and Heritage. Among the finds were a Ubaid period terracotta boat model, complete with a socket amidship for a mast and hole for stays and rudder, bevel-rimmed bowls, and a \"lizard type\" figurine like those found in a sounding under the Royal Cemetery of Ur. Soundings in the cemetery showed it to have about 1000 graves, all from the end of the Ubaid period (Temple levels VI and VII). They found a sequence of 17 Ubaid Period superseding temples and an Ubaid Period graveyard with 1000 graves of mud-brick boxes oriented to the southeast. The temple began as a 2 meter by 3 meter mud brick square with a niche. At Level XI it was rebuilt and eventually reached its final tripartite form in Level VI. In Ur III times a 300 square meter platform was constructed as a base for a ziggurat. These archaeological investigations showed that, according to A. Leo Oppenheim, \"eventually the entire south lapsed into stagnation, abandoning the political initiative to the rulers of the northern cities\", probably as a result of increasing salinity produced by continuous irrigation, and the city was abandoned in 600 BC. In 1990 the site was visited by A. M. T. Moore who found two areas of surface pottery kilns not noted by the earlier excavators.\nIn October 2014 Franco D’Agostino visited the site in preparation for the coming resumption of excavation, noting a number of inscribed Amar-Sin brick fragments on the surface. In 2019, excavations at Eridu were resumed by a joint Italian, French, and Iraqi effort which included the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University of Strasbourg. Work has included producing new detail topographic and photogrammetric maps and is mainly focused on the Ubaid period cemetery and its associated Ubaid residential area.\n\nArtifacts\nIn March 2006, Giovanni Pettinato and S. Chiod from Rome's La Sapienza University claimed to have discovered 500 Early Dynastic historical and literary cuneiform tablets on the surface at Eridu \"disturbed by an explosion\". The tablets were said to be from 2600 to 2100 BC (rulers Eannatum to Amar-Sin) and be part of a library. A team was sent to the site by Iraq's State Board of Antiquities and Heritage which found no tablets, only stamped bricks from Eridu and surrounding sites such as Ur. Nor was there a permit to excavate at the site issued to anyone. At this point Pettinato stated that they had actually found 70 inscribed bricks. This turned out to be stamped bricks used to build the modern Eridu dig-house. The dig-house had been built using bricks from the demolished Leonard Woolley’s  expedition house at Ur (clearly spelled out in the 1981 Iraqi excavation report to avoid confusion to future archaeologists). Most of the bricks\nin question were returned to Ur in 1962 for use in restoration efforts.\n\nArchitecture\nTemple and ziggurat\nThe urban nucleus of Eridu was Enki's temple, called House of the Aquifer (Cuneiform: 𒂍𒍪𒀊, E₂.ZU.AB; Sumerian: e₂-abzu; Akkadian: bītu apsû), which in later history was called House of the Waters (Cuneiform: 𒂍𒇉, E₂.LAGAB×HAL; Sumerian: e₂-engur; Akkadian: bītu engurru). The name refers to Enki's realm. His consort Ninhursag had a nearby temple at Ubaid.\nDuring the Ur III period Ur-Nammu had a ziggurat built over the remains of previous temples.\nAside from Enmerkar of Uruk (as mentioned in the Aratta epics), several later historical Sumerian kings are said in inscriptions found here to have worked on or renewed the e-abzu temple, including Elili of Ur; Ur-Nammu, Shulgi and Amar-Sin of Ur-III, and Nur-Adad of Larsa.\n\nLament for Eridu\nThe fall of early Mesopotamia cities and empires was typically believed to be the result of falling out of favor with the gods. A genre called City Laments developed during the Isin-Larsa period, of which the Lament for Ur is the most famous. These laments had a number of sections (kirugu) of which only fragments have been recovered. The Lament for Eridu describes the fall of that city.\n\n\"Its king stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. Father Enki stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. For the sake of his harmed city, he wept bitter tears. Its lady, like a flying bird, left her city. The mother of E-maḫ, holy Damgalnuna, left her city. The divine powers of the city of holiest divine powers were overturned. The divine powers of the rites of the greatest divine powers were altered. In Eridug everything was reduced to ruin, was wrought with confusion.\"\n\nHistory\nEridu is one of the earliest settlements in the region, founded c. 5400 BC during the early Ubaid period, at that time close to the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Euphrates, although in modern times it is about 90 miles inland. Excavation has shown that the city was founded on a virgin sand dune site with no previous habitation. According to the excavators, construction of the Ur III ziggurat and associated buildings was preceded by the destruction of preceding construction and its use as leveling fill so no remains from that time were found. At a small mound 1 kilometer north of Eridu two Early Dynastic III palaces were found, with an enclosure wall. The palaces measured 45 meters by 65 meters with 2.6 meter wide walls and were constructed in the standard Early Dynastic period method of plano-convex bricks laid in a herringbone fashion.\n\nWith possible breaks in occupation in the Early Dynastic III and Akkadian Empire periods, the city was inhabited until the Neo-Babylonian Empire, though in later times it was primarily a cultic site.\n\nDuring the Ubaid period the site extended out to an area of about 12 hectares (about 30 acres). Twelve neolithic clay tokens, the precursor to Proto-cuneiform, were found in the Ubaid levels of the site. Eighteen superimposed mudbrick temples at the site underlie the unfinished ziggurat of Amar-Sin (c. 2047–2039 BC). Levels XIX to VI were from the Ubaid period and Levels V to I were dated to the Uruk period. Significant habitation was found from the Uruk period with \"non-secular\" buildings being found in soundings. Uruk finds included decorative terracotta cones topped with copper, copper nails topped with gold, a pair of basalt stone lion statues, columns several meters in diameter coated with cones and gypsum, and extensive Uruk period pottery. Occupation increased in the Early Dynastic period with a monumental  100 meter by 100 meter palace being constructed. An inscription of Elulu, a ruler of the First Dynasty of Ur (c. 2600 BC), was found at Eridu. On a statue of the Early Dynastic ruler of Lagash named Entemena (c. 2400 BC), it reads, \"he built Ab-zupasira for Enki, king of Eridu  ...\",\n\nEridu was active during the Third Dynasty of Ur (22nd to 21st century BC) and royal building activity is known from inscribed bricks notably those of Ur-Nammu from his ziggurat marked \"Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, the one who built the temple of the god Enki in Eridu.\" Three Third Dynasty rulers designated Year Names based on the appointment of an en(tu)-priestess (high priestess) of the temple of Enki in Eridu, the highest religious office in the land at that time. In each the first two cases it was also used as the succeeding Year Name.\n\nSulgi Year 28 - \"Year the szita-priest-who-intercedes-for-Szulgi, the son of Szulgi, the strong man, the king of Ur, the king of the four corners of the universe, was installed as en-priest of Enki in Eridu\"\nAmar-Sin Year 8 - \"Year (Ennune-kiag-Amar-Sin) Ennune-the beloved (of Amar-Sin, was installed as en-priestess of Enki in Eridu)\"\nIbbi-Sin Year 11 - \"Year the szita-priest who prays piously for Ibbi-Sin was chosen by means of the omens as en-priest of Enki in Eridu\"\n\nAfter the fall of Ur III the site was occupied and active during the Isin-Larsa period  (early 2nd Millennium BC) as evidenced by a Year Name of Nur-Adad, ruler of Larsa \"Year the temple of Enki in Eridu was built\" and prior texts of Isin rulers Ishbi-Erra and Ishme-Dagan showing control over Eridu. Inscribed construction bricks of Nur-Adad have also been found at Eridu. This continued in the Old Babylonian period with Hammurabi stating in his 33rd Year Name \"Year Hammu-rabi the king dug the canal (called) 'Hammu-rabi is abundance to the people', the beloved of An and Enlil, established the everlasting waters of plentifulness for Nippur, Eridu, Ur, Larsa, Uruk and Isin, restored Sumer and Akkad which had been scattered, overthrew in battle the army of Mari and Malgium and caused Mari and its territory and the various cities of Subartu to dwell under his authority in friendship\"\n\nIn an inscription of Kurigalzu I (c. 1375 BC), a ruler of the Kassite dynasty one of his epitaphs is \"[he  one  who  ke]eps  the  sanctuary  in  Eridu  in  order\".\nAn inscription of the Second Sealand Dynastic ruler Simbar-shipak (c. 1021–1004 BCE) mentions a priest of Eridu.\nThe Neo-Assyrian emperor Sargon II (722–705 BCE) awarded andurāru-status (described as \"a periodic reinstatement of goods and persons, alienated because of want, to their original status\") to Eridu.\nThe Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) built at Eridu as evidenced by inscribed bricks found there.\n\nMythology\nIn some, but not all, versions of the Sumerian King List, Eridu is the first of five cities where kingship was received before a flood came over the land. The list mentions two rulers of Eridu from the Early Dynastic period, Alulim and Alalngar.\n\nIn Sumerian mythology, Eridu was the home of the Abzu temple of the god Enki, the Sumerian counterpart of the Akkadian god Ea, god of deep waters, wisdom and magic. Like all the Sumerian and Babylonian gods, Enki/Ea began as a local god who, according to the later cosmology, came to share the rule of the cosmos with Anu and Enlil. His kingdom was the sweet waters that lay below earth (Sumerian ab=water; zu=far).\nThe bright star Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and represented the city of Eridu in the Three Stars Each Babylonian star catalogues and later around 1100 BC on the MUL.APIN tablets. Canopus was called MUL.NUNKI by the Babylonians, which translates as \"star of the city of Eridu\". From most southern city of Mesopotamia, Eridu, there is a good view to the south, so that about 6000 years ago due to the precession of the Earth's axis the first rising of the star Canopus in Mesopotamia could be observed only from there at the southern meridian at midnight. In the city of Ur this was the case only 60 years later.\nIn the flood myth tablet found in Ur, how Eridu and Alulim were chosen by gods as first city and first priest-king is described in more detail. The following is the English translation of the tablet:\n\nAdapa, a man of Eridu, is depicted as an early culture hero. Although earlier tradition, Me-Turan/Tell-Haddad tablet, describes Adapa as postdiluvian ruler of Eridu, in late tradition, Adapa came to be viewed as Alulim’s vizier, and he was considered to have brought civilization to the city as the sage of King Alulim.\n\nThe stories of Inanna, goddess of Uruk, describe how she had to go to Eridu in order to receive the gifts of civilization. At first Enki, the god of Eridu, attempted to retrieve these sources of his power but later willingly accepted that Uruk now was the centre of the land.\n\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nAbzu\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nEridu Genesis\nLake Hammar\nTepe Gawra\n\nReferences\nCitations\nFurther reading\nEspak, Peeter, \"Was Eridu The First City in Sumerian Mythology\", Studia in Honorem Tarmo Kulmar.

      "summary": "Eridu (Sumerian: 𒉣𒆠, romanized: NUN.KI; Sumerian: eridugki; Akkadian: irîtu) was a Sumerian city located at Tell Abu Shahrain (Arabic: تل أبو شهرين), also Abu Shahrein or Tell Abu Shahrayn, an archaeological site in Lower Mesopotamia. It is located in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq, near the modern city of Basra. Eridu is traditionally considered the earliest city in southern Mesopotamia based on the Sumerian King List. Located 24 kilometers south-southwest of the ancient site of Ur, Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of Sumerian cities that grew around temples, almost in sight of one another. The city gods of Eridu were Enki and his consort Damkina. Enki, later known as Ea, was considered to have founded the city.

      "content": "Eridu (en arabe : ʾirīdū, إريدو) est une ancienne ville antique de Mésopotamie, située au Sud du pays de Sumer (actuel Sud de l'Irak). Ses ruines se trouvent sur plusieurs tells dispersés sur une vaste zone, à une vingtaine de kilomètres au sud-ouest d’Ur, le site principal étant Abu Shahrain (en arabe : tall ʾabū šahrayn, تل أبو شهرين).\n\nHistoire\nSelon la tradition sumérienne, telle qu'on la trouve dans la liste royale sumérienne, Eridu est la première ville à avoir reçu la royauté, quand celle-ci, selon l’expression de ce texte, « est descendue du Ciel ». Cependant il n'est pas assuré que cette tradition ait des fondements historiques. Aux périodes historiques, cette ville n’a jamais été le siège d’un royaume puissant. Elle est en revanche une ville importante sur le plan religieux, puisque c’est la cité du grand dieu Enki/Ea, où se trouve son grand temple, l'É.ABZU, et de ce fait la ville apparaît souvent dans la littérature sumérienne. Si elle est parfois mentionnée comme un port important, Eridu n’est cependant pas située au bord du golfe Persique aux époques historiques, mais plutôt sur une lagune reliée à la mer.\nComme la plupart des sites de Basse Mésopotamie, Eridu fut abandonné dans le courant des XVIIIe et XVIIe siècles av. J.-C., et ne fut plus le lieu d’une occupation importante par la suite. Des traces d'occupation des époques d'Isin-Larsa, de la dynastie kassite, puis de l'époque néo-babylonienne ont été repérées à la surface de différents tells situés sur le site. Nabuchodonosor II de Babylone y restaura le sanctuaire d'Enki au début du VIe siècle av. J.-C.\n\nRecherches archéologiques\nLe site a été prospecté par John George Taylor en 1854 et par Reginald Campbell Thompson en 1918, puis H. R. Hall en 1919. Des fouilles plus complètes ont été effectuées entre 1946 et 1950 par le service des antiquités de l’Irak, sous la direction de Fuad Safar, assisté par S. Lloyd à partir de 1948. Eridu n’a pas livré d’important matériel épigraphique. Les fouilles ont repris sous la direction de l'Université de Strasbourg et l'Université de Rome « La Sapienza » depuis 2018.\n\nC’est autour de la zone sacrée, située au centre du tell, que se sont concentrées les fouilles. Ce secteur était ceint d'une muraille intérieure quadrangulaire de 400 × 300 mètres de côté. On y a repéré 19 niveaux archéologiques, ce qui a permis la constitution d’une longue séquence chronologique importante pour notre connaissance de la protohistoire du sud mésopotamien. Les découvertes se sont essentiellement concentrées dans le secteur du temple d'Eridu, qui présente le plus ancien exemple d'architecture monumentale dans le Sud mésopotamien, remontant aux débuts de l'époque d'Obeid (début du Ve millénaire av. J.-C.). Un sondage réalisé en un point du site (« Hut Sounding ») a permis de préciser la séquence archéologique allant de l'époque d'Obeid jusqu'aux Dynasties archaïques (IIIe millénaire av. J.-C.). Par ailleurs, un cimetière de la fin de l'Obeïd a été exploré au nord-ouest du site par les équipes irakiennes.\n\nJ. Oates a identifié sur ce site les principales phases de la période d'Obeid : les niveaux les plus anciens, XIX à XV, correspondent à la période 1 (ou période d'Eridu) ; la période suivante, Obeid 2 ou Hajji Mohammad, va des niveaux XIV à XII ; l'Obeid 3 (ou Obeid à proprement parler), des niveaux XI à VIII ; et l'Obeid 4 (ou Obeid tardif), des niveaux VII à VI.\nSur le tell principal, dans la zone sacrée, a été mise au jour une séquence de quatorze « temples » sur terrasse superposés au cours du temps, témoignant d’une grande continuité sur une période très longue, depuis l'époque d'Obeid jusqu'à la fin de la période d'Uruk, donc d'environ 5000 à 3000 av. J.-C. C’est un des exemples les plus remarquables du développement progressif de l’architecture monumentale en Basse Mésopotamie, en un même lieu, vu comme un signe de la continuité culturelle dans le Sud mésopotamien aux époques protohistoriques. Le « temple » le plus ancien, au niveau XVI, est un petit édifice en briques de forme rectangulaire, avec en son centre un podium ayant pu servir d'autel pour les offrandes et un autre podium situé dans une niche sur son côté nord-ouest. Les constructions suivantes reprennent un plan similaire, mais leur taille va croissante avec le temps, et des salles latérales sont ajoutées sur les deux côtés de la salle initiale, qui conserve son rôle principal, donnant ainsi à l'édifice un plan tripartite. Ses façades sont agrémentées d'un décor à niches et redans typique du Sud mésopotamien. Pour la phase finale de l'Obeid (niveau VI), de grandes quantités de restes de poissons ont été exhumées, sans doute des offrandes alimentaires destinées à la divinité de l'édifice.\n\nLa Période d'Uruk est représentée par les niveaux V à I du temple, mais les restes des édifices sont trop érodés pour avoir livré un plan compréhensible. On a en revanche trouvé un bâtiment de la fin de cette période ailleurs sur le tell. Pour le Dynastique archaïque, un palais a été retrouvé au nord du site sur un tell isolé. À la fin du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C, le roi Ur-Nammu d’Ur restaure le temple d'Enki et y adjoint une ziggurat, ayant une base rectangulaire de dimensions 61,80 sur 46,50 mètres. On parvenait à son sommet par trois escaliers, le principal étant perpendiculaire à l'édifice. Le complexe sacré d'Enki, comprenant également le temple du dieu et des dépendances, était entouré d'une enceinte. Sur le tell nord se trouvait à cette même période un édifice palatial, en fait divisé en deux bâtiments, un au nord et un au sud, plus imposant, que pourraient être selon les fouilleurs du site les résidences respectives des grands prêtres de la déesse Damgalnunna et du dieu Enlil.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\n(en) Michael D.
