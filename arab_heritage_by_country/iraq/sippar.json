      "content": "Sippar (Sumerian: 𒌓𒄒𒉣𒆠, Zimbir) (also Sippir or Sippara) was an ancient Near Eastern Sumerian and later Babylonian city on the east bank of the Euphrates river. Its tell is located at the site of modern Tell Abu Habbah near Yusufiyah in Iraq's Baghdad Governorate, some 69 km (43 mi) north of Babylon and 30 km (19 mi) southwest of Baghdad. The city's ancient name, Sippar, could also refer to its sister city, Sippar-Amnanum (located at the modern site of Tell ed-Der); a more specific designation for the city here referred to as Sippar was Sippar-Yaḫrurum (Sippar-Jaḫrurum). The name comes from the Amorite Yaḫrurum tribe that lived in the area along with the Amorite Amnanum tribe. In Sippar was the site where the Babylonian Map of the World was found.\n\nHistory\nWhile pottery finds indicate that the site of Sippar was in use as early as the Uruk period, substantial occupation occurred only in the Early Dynastic and Akkadian Empire periods of the 3rd millennium BC, the Old Babylonian and Kassite periods of the 2nd millennium BC, and the Neo-Babylonian times of the 1st millennium BC. Lesser levels of use continued into the time of the Achaemenid, Seleucid and Parthian Empires.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nDespite the fact that thousands of cuneiform clay tablets have been recovered at the site, relatively little is known about the history of Sippar. In the Sumerian king list a king of Sippar, En-men-dur-ana, is listed as one of the early pre-dynastic rulers of the region but has not yet turned up in the epigraphic records.\n\nAkkadian period\nSippar was the cult site of the sun god (Sumerian Utu, Akkadian Shamash), along with his consort Aya, and the home of his temple E-babbara (𒂍𒌓𒌓𒊏, means \"white house\") where the Cruciform Monument of Manishtushu was found. Mamu, the daughter of Shamash, also had a temple in Sippar as did the goddesses Nin-Isina, Ninḫegal, Ninkarrak, and Tašmētum.\nIn the later part of the 3rd millennium BC, a large coalition of city-states led by Iphur-Kis of Kish (Sumer) and Amar-Girid of Uruk, joined by Enlil-nizu of Nippur, and including the city-states of \"Kutha, TiWA, Sippar, Kazallu, Kiritab, [Api]ak   and GN\" as well as \"Amorite  [hi]ghlanders\" revolted against Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin of Akkad. The rebellion was joined by the city of Borsippa, among others. The revolt was crushed.\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nSippar was the production center of wool. It also produced some of the finest Old Babylonian cylinder seals.\n\nMiddle Bronze I\nIn Middle Bronze IB (c. 1900-1820 BC), the city-state of Babylon started to expand. Sippar eventually came within the Babylonian realm. Sumu-la-El of Babylon (r. 1878-1843 BC) conducted several military campaigns gaining control over Sippar. In his 29th year of reign, Sumulael reported building the city wall of Sippar. Sabium (r. 1842-1829 BC) did some religious activity dedicated to Utu/Shamash, Marduk in one of his year-names. Apil-Sin (r. 1828-1812 BC) did some activity in Sippar in his Year 14.\nBased on Shamash Temple records Sippar ruler Immerum is known to have been roughly contemporary with the rule of Sumu-la-El. He is suggested to have been ruling Sippar when Babylon took control based on a text sealed with oaths to both Immerum and Sumu-la-El. In another text detailing gifts for dignitaries Sumu-abum, first ruler of the First Babylonian Empire received the largest gift with Immerum and Sumu-la-El (2nd ruler of that empire) receiving smaller gifts. Four year names of Immerum are known including \"The year (in which) the temple of Inanna Immerum built\".\n\nMiddle Bronze II (c. 1820-1587 BC)\nSin-Muballit (r. 1811-1793 BC) controlled the city and a sealed clay envelope is known.\n\nSome years later Hammurabi of Babylon (r. 1792-1750 BC) reported laying the foundations of the city wall of Sippar in his 23rd year and worked on the wall again in his 43rd year. His successor in Babylon, Samsu-iluna (r. 1749-1712 BC) worked on Sippar's wall in his 1st year. The city walls, being typically made of mud bricks, required much attention. The Code of Hammurabi stele was probably erected at Sippar. Shamash was the god of justice, and he is depicted handing authority to the king in the image at the top of the stele.\nThe city flourished under Babylonian rule until the Sack of Babylon by Mursili I of Hatti around 1587 BC.\n\nLate Bronze Age\nKassite period\nThe city then came under the control of the Kassite dynasty.\n\nElamite period\nIn the final years of that dynasty the Elamite ruler Shutruk-Nakhunte (c. 1184 to 1155 BC) captured Sippar. Shutruk-Nakhunte carried back statues from the Shamash temple to Susa adding his own inscription to a stele of the Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin:\n\n\"I am Shutruk-Nahhunte, son of Hallutush-Inshushinak, beloved servant of the god Inshushinak, king of Anshan and Susa, who has enlarged the kingdom, who takes care of the lands of Elam, the lord of the land of Elam. When the god Inshushinak gave me the order, I defeated Sippar. I took the stele of Naram-Sin and carried it off, bringing it to the land of Elam. For Inshushinak, my god, I set it as an offering.\"\n\nIron Age\nNeo-Babylonian period\nIn the succeeding Late Bronze Age collapse period, it was taken by the Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar I about 1120 BC. In the reign of Neo-Babylonian ruler Adad-apla-iddina (c. 1064–1043 BC) the Shamash cult center along with all the other temples in Sippar were destroyed by Suteans and cult symbol of Shamash was lost.\n\nNeo-Assyrian period\nIn the early 1st millennium BC, Sippar came under Neo-Assyrian control. After the final defeat of the Neo-Assyrians by the Neo-Babylonians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC text report that a number of Egyptian and Assyrian prisoners were brought to Sippar as chattel. Records of Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BC) and Nabonidos (556-539 BC) record that they repaired the Shamash temple E-babbara.\n\nAchaemenid period\nAfter the Battle of Opis in September 539 BC Sippar surrendered to the Achaemenid Empire, followed soon after by the fall of the Neo-Babylonian empire.\n\nSpeculation\nXisuthros, the \"Chaldean Noah\" in Sumerian mythology, is said by Berossus to have buried the records of the antediluvian world here—possibly because the name of Sippar was supposed to be connected with sipru, \"a writing\". And according to Abydenus, Nebuchadnezzar II excavated a great reservoir in the neighbourhood.\nPliny (Natural History 6.30.123) mentions a sect of Chaldeans called the Hippareni. It is often assumed that this name refers to Sippar (especially because the other two schools mentioned seem to be named after cities as well: the Orcheni after Uruk, and the Borsippeni after Borsippa), but this is not universally accepted.\nSippar has been suggested as the location of the Biblical Sepharvaim in the Old Testament, which alludes to the two parts of the city in its dual form.\n\nArchaeology\nTell Abu Habba, measuring over 1 square kilometer was first excavated by Hormuzd Rassam (referring to the site as Aboo-Habba) between 1880 and 1881 for the British Museum in a dig that lasted 18 months. Rassam excavated only down to the Old Babylonian levels and was focused mainly on the Neo-Babylonian remains. Tens of thousands of tablets were recovered including the Tablet of Shamash in the Temple of Shamash/Utu. Most of the tablets were Neo-Babylonian. The temple had been mentioned as early as the 18th year of Samsu-iluna of Babylon, who reported restoring \"Ebabbar, the temple of Szamasz in Sippar\", along with the city's ziggurat.\nThe tablets, which ended up in the British Museum, are being studied to this day. As was often the case in the early days of archaeology, excavation records were not made, particularly find spots. This makes it difficult to tell which tablets came from Sippar-Amnanum as opposed to Sippar. Other tablets from Sippar were bought on the open market during that time and ended up at places like the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania. Since the site is relatively close to Baghdad, it was a popular target for illegal excavations.\nIn 1894, Sippar was worked briefly by Jean-Vincent Scheil. The tablets recovered, mainly Old Babylonian, went to the Istanbul Museum. In 1927 archaeologists Walter Andrae and Julius Jordan visited, and mapped, the site. In modern times, the site was worked, mainly soundings, by a Belgian team led by H. Gasche from 1972 to 1973. They determined that Sippar was protected by a wall, partially for flood protection, extending 1200 meters by 800 meters, cutting a trench across it. A tablet of Samsu-iluna was found showing the wall dated back to at least Old Babylonian period though ground water prevented deeper excavation.\n\nIraqi archaeologists from the College of Arts at the University of Baghdad, led by Walid al-Jadir with Farouk al-Rawi, have excavated at Tell Abu Habbah starting in 1978. Work began with a new site contour map and excavation in the Old Babylonian area in the north where two buildings were uncovered. About 100 Old Babylonian period cuneiform tablets were found. Subsequently, the team worked in an Old Babylonian residential area where terracotta plaques and figurines, and cuneiform tablets were found. The tablets were from the reign of Immerum, Buntahun-ila, and Samsu-iluna. Focus then shifted to the Shamash temple area. In the northeast, Old Babylonian part of the site, a 30 meter by 5 meter deep sounding was excavated. The sounding found 4 Old Babylonian levels, 2 Akkadian Empire levels, and 3 Early Dynastic levels ( with plano-convex mud brick construction). In 1986, while clearing spoil from the Rassam excavation in the E-Babbar temple, a room was discovered which Rassam had not noticed. It contained a library with about 400 cuneiform tablets, which had been stored in 10 ranks of 17cm by 30cm niches in 4 rows. The tablets included copies of earlier inscriptions dating back to the Akkadian Empire and contemporary texts as late as the reign of Cambyses II. Few of the tablets were published at the time due to conditions in Iraq. With conditions improving, they are now being published. After 2000, they were joined by the German Archaeological Institute. In total, the effort continued in 24 seasons until 2002. In the 24th season in 2002, 700 cuneiform\ntablets were found in one important building in the center of town. Most date to the\nreign of Ammi-Saduqa (c. 1646–1626 BC) a ruler of the First Dynasty of Babylon with \na few from Abi-Eshuh (c. 1711-1684 BC) and Ammi-Ditana (c. 1683-1647 BC).\n\nGallery\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nCylinders of Nabonidus\nNadītu in Sippar\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nF.

      "summary": "Sippar (Sumerian: 𒌓𒄒𒉣𒆠, Zimbir) (also Sippir or Sippara) was an ancient Near Eastern Sumerian and later Babylonian city on the east bank of the Euphrates river. Its tell is located at the site of modern Tell Abu Habbah near Yusufiyah in Iraq's Baghdad Governorate, some 69 km (43 mi) north of Babylon and 30 km (19 mi) southwest of Baghdad. The city's ancient name, Sippar, could also refer to its sister city, Sippar-Amnanum (located at the modern site of Tell ed-Der); a more specific designation for the city here referred to as Sippar was Sippar-Yaḫrurum (Sippar-Jaḫrurum). The name comes from the Amorite Yaḫrurum tribe that lived in the area along with the Amorite Amnanum tribe. In Sippar was the site where the Babylonian Map of the World was found.",

      "content": "Sippar (sans doute plutôt prononcé Sippir dans l'Antiquité, écrit Zimbir en idéogramme sumérien) est une ville de la Mésopotamie antique, située au nord-ouest de Babylone, sur le site actuel d'Abu Habbah. Il s'agit d'une des villes les plus importantes de la Babylonie des IIe millénaire av. J.-C. et Ier millénaire av. J.-C., où se trouvait l'un des principaux sanctuaires de Shamash, le Dieu du Soleil. Ce site a livré des dizaines de milliers de tablettes cunéiformes, ce qui en fait un des sites antiques les mieux documentés par l'épigraphie.\nUne autre ville portait le nom de Sippar, située à sept kilomètres à peine de la première (ce qui en fait plutôt une sorte de faubourg), sur l'actuel site de Tell ed-Der. Pour les distinguer les textes antiques appellent souvent la première « Sippar de Shamash » et la seconde « Sippar d'Annunitum », suivant leurs divinités tutélaires.\n\nHistorique\nLa ville de Sippar est citée comme l'une des plus anciennes de la Mésopotamie dans la Liste royale sumérienne. Elle aurait été la quatrième ville a exercer la royauté, l'avant-dernière avant le Déluge. Cette dynastie ne comporte qu'un roi, Enmenduranna, qui aurait régné vingt-et-un mille ans. Comme souvent avec cette source, il s'agit probablement d'une fiction. Les niveaux anciens des deux villes ayant porté le nom de Sippar ne sont pas connus, et l'archéologie ne peut confirmer l'ancienneté de cette ville.\nLe site d'Abu Habbah a livré des objets semblant attester d'une occupation dès la période d'Uruk, dans la seconde moitié du IVe millénaire av. J.-C. Mais les phases les plus anciennes du site ne sont pas connues par l'archéologie. Les textes semblent indique que Sippar devient une ville importante dans le courant du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C.\nC'est au début du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. que la ville devient l'une des plus importantes de la Mésopotamie méridionale. C'est alors que se développe la cité jumelle portant également le nom de Sippar, sur le site de Tell ed-Der. Les deux villes sont distinguées de plusieurs manières : Abu Habbah est appelée tantôt Sippar de Shamash, d'autres fois Sippar des Yahrurum (une tribu amorrite), Sippar de la steppe ; ed-Der est appelée Sippar d'Annunitum, Sippar des Amnanum (une autre tribu), Sippar de la muraille. Les villes ont connu une période d'indépendance après la chute de la troisième dynastie d'Ur, car une série de rois semblant régner autour de 1900 av. J.-C. est connue par quelques textes, qui ne permettent pas de clarifier leur ordre de succession : Altinu'u, Immerum, Buntahtun-ila, et Sîn-bani. Mais Sippar passe ensuite sous la domination du royaume voisin de Babylone, sans doute sous le règne de Sumu-la-El (1881 à 1845 av. J.-C.), pour ne plus jamais la quitter. Les souverains de Babylone ont été particulièrement actif dans cette grande ville proche de leur capitale, dont ils restaurent à plusieurs reprises les édifices principaux. Hammurabi dispose par ailleurs d'un palais à Sippar d'Annunitum où il réside à plusieurs reprises.\nSippar reste florissante lors de la période suivante de l'histoire babylonienne, sous les Kassites qui entretiennent à leur tour le sanctuaire de Shamash. Après la chute de cette dynastie la Babylonie connaît une période très troublée, avec notamment les incursions de tribus araméennes et chaldéennes, qui affectent particulièrement Sippar et son temple principal. Cette situation critique est connue par un document exceptionnel, la « Tablette du Dieu-Soleil », une inscription du roi Nabu-apla-iddina (888 à 855 av. J.-C.) qui rétablit le culte du temple de Shamash, en lui procurant une nouvelle statue de culte et en offrant des exemptions au sanctuaire, après une longue période d'arrêt du culte.\nLa prospérité de la ville sous l'empire néo-babylonien (626-539 av. J.-C.) et au début de l'époque des Perses Achéménides (539-480 av. J.-C.) est connue par les abondantes archives du temple de Shamash, qui documentent notamment sa vie économique. L'autre Sippar semble en revanche avoir perdu en importance, bien que le temple d'Annunitu soit encore restauré par Nabonide (555-539 av. J.-C.) et qu'elle soit encore occupée à l'époque perse. Une troisième Sippar apparaît dans quelques textes d'époque récente, Sippar-Aruru, qui semble localisée au nord-est des deux autres Sippar, près d'Opis ; il semble en fait que ce soit un autre nom de la ville appelée Dur-Sharruku/Dur-Sharrukin (à ne pas confondre avec la ville assyrienne de même nom) qui apparaît plus souvent dans les textes, depuis la fin du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. jusqu'au VIe siècle av. J.-C..\n\nFouilles\nLe site d'Abu Habbah a fait l'objet d'un premier repérage et de plans par W. B. Selby et J. B. Bewsher vers 1860. \nLes fouilles y ont débuté en 1881 sous la direction d'Hormuzd Rassam, qui explora l'espace de dix-huit mois le secteur du temple de Shamash et en dressa les premiers plan, et en rapporta près de soixante mille tablettes et fragments de tablettes, dont beaucoup sont issus de fouilles clandestines. \nEn 1894, le site fut fouillé brièvement par le père Jean-Vincent Scheil, qui s'intéressa notamment au secteur des résidences des prêtresse de Shamash. Il fut à nouveau fouillé en 1927 par les Allemands Walter Andrae et Julius Jordan. \nIl fut ensuite exploré par des archéologues irakiens, dans les années 1940 puis à partir de 1978 et jusqu'à la première guerre d'Iraq, sous la direction de Walid al-Jadir, dans les secteurs résidentiels et sacrés (mise au jour d'une bibliothèque en 1985).\n\nOrganisation du site\nAbu Habbah est un site d'environ 100 hectares, de forme grossièrement rectangulaire, avec pour dimensions environ 1 300 mètres sur 800. Ses limites sur trois côtés sont marquées par des levées de terre d'environ 7 mètres de large, qui ont sans doute servi de digues et ont apparemment recouvert la muraille de la ville, connue notamment parce qu'elles ont été construites (ou restaurées) par Hammurabi. Le site était bordé par un canal joignant le Tigre à l'Euphrate, qui reliait la ville à l'autre Sippar. Il était constitué de deux tells principaux, celui du sud-ouest comprenant le sanctuaire de Shamash, et celui du nord-ouest comprenant des quartiers résidentiels.\n\nL'Ebabbar, temple du Dieu-Soleil\nLes édifices\nLe cœur de la ville était le temple du dieu-Soleil Shamash, l'Ebabbar, « Demeure Brillante » en sumérien. C'est un édifice ancien, déjà l'un des sanctuaires majeurs de la Mésopotamie dans la seconde moitié du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C., en particulier sous les rois d'Akkad (XXIIIe siècle av. J.-C.). Il fut par la suite restauré régulièrement par les rois babyloniens. Son état tel qu'il a été dégagé lors des fouilles est celui de la période néo-babylonienne (VIe siècle av. J.-C.), étant rénové par les rois Nabopolassar et Nabonide. Il semble avoir cessé d'être en activité au début du Ve siècle av. J.-C., sous les premiers rois Perses achéménides.\nLe sanctuaire reprenait alors les éléments caractéristiques des grands temples babyloniens récents. Il était entouré par une enceinte délimitant l'espace sacré (320 × 240 m), et organisé autour d'une grande cour bordée de pièces ayant une fonction administrative. À l'ouest se trouvait le lieu de culte de Shamash, constitué d'un vestibule et d'une cella où se trouvait la statue du dieu. Il était encadré par deux autres lieux de culte, celui de sa parèdre Aya, et celui de son vizir Bunene. Dans une cour située derrière ces temples avait été érigée une ziggourat, de base 37 × 30 mètres, dont les ruines s'élèvent encore à une quinzaine de mètres de hauteur. Son nom cérémoniel était é-kun-an-ku-ga, « Demeure, Seuil du Ciel Pur ».\n\nLes archives\nD'importants lots de tablettes ont été dégagés dans le quartier sacré, par des fouilleurs clandestins. Une fois remis vaguement en ordre (l'ampleur de la documentation ne facilitant pas les choses), on a pu repérer plusieurs lots d'archives : celles d'un « cloître » de l'époque paléo-babylonienne (XIXe – XVIIe siècles av. J.-C.) habité par des religieuses consacrées à Shamash, les archives du temple de l'époque néo-babylonienne (VIe siècle av. J.-C.).\n\nPériode paléo-babylonienne\nLes archives concernent essentiellement la vie administrative et économique du temple. À l'époque paléo-babylonienne, son secteur administratif était dirigé par un personnage appelé šangum, qui était assisté par un intendant (šatammum) et ses deux assistants (šapirum). Le personnel religieux comprenait des « purificateurs » (pašīšum et gudapsûm), plutôt chargés des rites sacrificiels, des chantres (nārum), ainsi que de nombreux prébendiers se partageant à tout de rôle des charges cultuelles. Les devins haruspices (bārûm) attestés dans la documentation de l'époque ne sont pas rattachés au sanctuaire. La catégorie de clergé (au sens large) la mieux connue est celle des prêtresses appelées nāditum, grâce aux importantes archives qu'elles ont laissé. Souvent issues de familles de notables, elles avaient été vouées au dieu Shamash dès leur adolescence, ne devaient pas enfanter et étaient astreintes au célibat. Elles habitaient dans un secteur appelé gāgum, souvent traduit par « cloître », même si elles n'y étaient pas cloîtrées puisqu'elles pouvaient aller et venir librement. Elles y disposaient de résidences, de bâtiments administratifs, de magasins, d'ateliers. Leur rôle économique semble avoir été important, alors qu'elles n'avaient apparemment pas de fonctions cultuelles, puisque leur lien avec le culte semble surtout avoir été de faire des offrandes. Ces religieuses avaient été richement dotées par leur famille, et pouvaient disposer librement de ces biens pour mener leurs affaires de propriétaires terriennes, ou bien de prêteuses et d'investisseur dans le commerce. Elles disposaient donc d'une liberté économique inhabituelle pour des femmes à cette période. De fait, on connaît plusieurs litiges relatifs à leur héritage, qui était très convoité, et devait en principe revenir à leur famille.\n\nPériode néo-babylonienne\nLes archives de l'époque néo-babylonienne concernent plus le domaine du temple. La provenance exacte des tablettes sur le site n'a pas été systématiquement répertoriée à l'époque de leur dégagement, mais une bonne moitié provient d'une seule pièce localisée dans les bâtiments de la partie sud du sanctuaire. Environ 32 000 tablettes de cette époque ont été cataloguées au British Museum, datées de la période 625-486 av. J.-C., donc l'époque néo-babylonienne et le début de l'époque achéménide. Il s'agit pour l'essentiel de documents administratifs routiniers, à savoir des reçus, comptes, listes, mais on trouve aussi des contrats de prêt, de vente, aussi des lettres et textes scolaires. Une partie des tablettes est de nature privée.\nLes textes fournissent des informations sur l'organisation du sanctuaire. Il est alors dirigé par un grand prêtre portant le titre de « Grand frère » (ahu rabū) qui préside le collège (kiništu) des prêtres, le personnel cultuel comprend aussi des exorcistes (āšipu), des chantres (nāru), des bateliers (malāhu, pour les processions), et les divers métiers alimentaires impliqués dans les sacrifices. Le secteur administratif est placé sous la supervision du šangu et d'un assistant appelé qīpu. Il dispose d'environ 7 000 hectares de terres. Les terres à céréales étaient exploitées par un grand nombre de dépendants, les « cultivateurs » (ikkaru), regroupés en équipes chargées de l'exploitation d'une partie du domaine et devant reverser une part de la récolte au temple. Les palmeraies étaient exploitées ou bien par des salariés, ou bien par des prébendiers qui devaient reverser une part de la récolte affectée au culte. Le temple disposait également d'ateliers où travaillaient des artisans spécialisés, devant réaliser les objets destinés au culte.\nLa bibliothèque d'époque néo-babylonienne est un autre lot de tablette de première importance de cette époque. Elle a été mise au jour lors des fouilles irakiennes des années 1980, dans un angle de la grande cour, dans le secteur nord-ouest du sanctuaire qui semble avoir été destiné à la déesse Aya. Il s'agit d'une chambre de 4,40 × 2,70 mètres dont trois des murs disposaient d'étagères en argile et plâtre comprenant 56 casiers où étaient rangées les tablettes, à la verticale. Une salle plus vaste située avant pourrait avoir servi de lieu d'étude ou de copie. On y a retrouvé de nombreuses tablettes, les plus anciennes datées du XIe siècle av. J.-C., la plupart du VIe siècle av. J.-C., fournissant un échantillon représentatif de la culture des lettrés des temples néo-babyloniens : listes lexicales, textes cultuels (hymnes, prières, rituels), astronomiques/astrologiques, mathématiques, copies de vieilles inscriptions royales, et des mythes (Lugal-e, Atrahasis, Enuma Elish).\n\nLes résidences\nPlusieurs résidences ont été mises au jour lors des fouilles irakiennes d'Abu Habbah, datant de l'époque paléo-babylonienne.\nUn premier ensemble a été dégagé au chantier U 106, au nord-ouest. Il s'agit de grandes maisons, souvent organisées autour de cour centrales, desservies par des ruelles et une artère principale, suivant une disposition bien connue pour l'urbanisme de cette période. Elles se présentent sur plusieurs niveaux datés d'entre le XIXe siècle av. J.-C. et le XVIIe siècle av. J.-C., sur la foi des tablettes qui y ont été retrouvées, s'étalant des règnes des rois de Sippar jusqu'à celui du babylonien Samsu-iluna.\nL'autre secteur résidentiel fouillé, V 108, situé à l'ouest de la ziggurat, présente une disposition plus originale. Il est organisé autour de ruelles étroites disposées de façon parallèle, isolant des sortes d’insulae comprenant de petites unités juxtaposées comprenant une ou deux pièces. Il s'agissait sans doute de logements destinés aux desservants du temple (le « cloître » des nāditum ?).\n\nRéférences\nBibliographie\nWalid al-Jadir, « Sippar : ville du dieu soleil », Dossiers Histoires et Archéologie, no 103 « La Babylonie »,‎ mars 1986, p. 52-54\n(en) Hermann Gasche et Caroline Janssen, « Sippar », dans Eric M.

      "summary": "Sippar (sans doute plutôt prononcé Sippir dans l'Antiquité, écrit Zimbir en idéogramme sumérien) est une ville de la Mésopotamie antique, située au nord-ouest de Babylone, sur le site actuel d'Abu Habbah. Il s'agit d'une des villes les plus importantes de la Babylonie des IIe millénaire av. J.-C. et Ier millénaire av. J.-C., où se trouvait l'un des principaux sanctuaires de Shamash, le Dieu du Soleil. Ce site a livré des dizaines de milliers de tablettes cunéiformes, ce qui en fait un des sites antiques les mieux documentés par l'épigraphie.\nUne autre ville portait le nom de Sippar, située à sept kilomètres à peine de la première (ce qui en fait plutôt une sorte de faubourg), sur l'actuel site de Tell ed-Der. Pour les distinguer les textes antiques appellent souvent la première « Sippar de Shamash » et la seconde « Sippar d'Annunitum », suivant leurs divinités tutélaires.",
