      "content": "Nineveh was an ancient Near Eastern city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of an Assyrian Christian bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 14th century AD after the massacres and dispersal of Assyrian Christians by Timur.\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, site of a shrine to Jonah. According to the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Jonah was a prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large numbers of Assyrian sculptures and other artifacts have been excavated from the ruins of Nineveh, and are now located in museums around the world.\n\nThe location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.\n\nName\nThe English placename Nineveh comes from the Latin Nīnevē and the Koine Greek Nineuḗ (Νινευή) under influence of the Biblical Hebrew Nīnəweh (נִינְוֶה), from the Akkadian Ninua (var. Ninâ) or Ninuwā. The city was also known as Ninuwa in Mari; Ninawa in Aramaic; Ninwe (ܢܸܢܘܵܐ) in Syriac; and Ninawa (نینوا) in Arabic.\n\nNabī Yūnus is the Arabic for \"Prophet Jonah\". Kuyunjiq was, according to Layard, a Turkish name (Layard used the form kouyunjik, diminutive of koyun \"sheep\" in Turkish); known as Armousheeah by the Arabs, it is thought to have some connection with the Qara Qoyunlu dynasty.\n\nGeography\nThe remains of ancient Nineveh, the areas of Kuyunjiq and Nabī Yūnus with their mounds, are located on a level part of the plain at the junction of the Tigris and the Khosr Rivers within an area of 750 hectares (1,900 acres) circumscribed by a 12-kilometre (7.5 mi) fortification wall. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins, roughly a third of these overlaid by the Nebi Yunus suburbs of the city of eastern Mosul.\nThe site of ancient Nineveh is bisected by the Khosr river. North of the Khosr, the site is called Kuyunjiq, including the acropolis of Tell Kuyunjiq; the illegal village of Rahmaniye lay in eastern Kuyunjiq. South of the Khosr, the urbanized area is called Nebi Yunus (also Ghazliya, Jezayr, Jammasa), including Tell Nebi Yunus, where are the mosque of the Prophet Jonah, and a palace of Esarhaddon/Ashurbanipal below it. South of the street Al-'Asady (made by Daesh by destroying swaths of the city walls) the area is called Junub Ninawah or Shara Pepsi.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic\nNineveh itself was founded as early as 6000 BC during the late Neolithic period. Deep sounding at Nineveh uncovered soil layers that have been dated to early in the era of the Hassuna archaeological culture. The development and culture of Nineveh paralleled Tepe Gawra and Tell Arpachiyah a few kilometers to the northeast. Nineveh was a typical farming village in the Halaf Period.\n\nChalcolithic\nUbaid period\nIn 5000 BC, Nineveh transitioned from a Halaf village to an Ubaid village. During the Late Chalcolithic period Nineveh was one of the few Ubaid villages in Upper Mesopotamia which became a proto-city. Others include Ugarit, Brak, Hamoukar, Arbela, Alep, and regionally Susa, Eridu, Nippur. During the period between 4500 and 4000 BC it grew to 40 hectares in size.\nThe greater Nineveh area is notable in the diffusion of metal technology across the near east as the first location outside of Anatolia to smelt copper. Tell Arpachiyah has the oldest copper smelting remains, and Tepe Gawra has the oldest metal work. The copper came from the mines at Ergani.\n\nUruk period\nNineveh IV became a trade colony of Uruk during the Uruk Expansion because of its location as the highest navigable point on the Tigris. It was contemporary with, and had a similar function to, Habuba Kabira on the Euphrates. Finds included beveled rim bowls.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nNinevite 5 period\nThe regional influence of Nineveh became particularly pronounced during the archaeological period known as Ninevite 5, or Ninevite V (3000/2900–2600/2500 BC). This period is defined primarily by the characteristic pottery that is found widely throughout Upper Mesopotamia. Also, for the Upper Mesopotamian region, the Early Jezirah chronology has been developed by archaeologists. According to this regional chronology, 'Ninevite 5' is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I–II period.\n\nNinevite 5 was preceded by the Late Uruk period. Ninevite 5 pottery is roughly contemporary to the Early Transcaucasian culture ware, and the Jemdet Nasr period ware. Iraqi Scarlet Ware culture also belongs to this period; this colourful painted pottery is somewhat similar to Jemdet Nasr ware. Scarlet Ware was first documented in the Diyala River basin in Iraq. Later, it was also found in the nearby Hamrin Basin, and in Luristan. It is also contemporary with the Proto-Elamite period in Susa.\nNinevite 5 can be subdivided into the Early Ninevite 5 (3000-2750 BC) characterized by painted pottery and Late Ninevite 5 (2750-2500 BC) with incised pottery. In southern Mesopotamia, the former is contemporary with ED I-II, while the latter mirrors ED II-IIIA.\n\nAkkadian period\nIn the late 3rd millennium BC Nineveh was part of the Akkadian Empire. While the site was occupied in that period, there was minimal official Akkadian presence there—unlike at Assur which had a much more notable presence. An Akkadian period bronze statue head found at Nineveh was later determined to be a 7th century addition.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nIn the early 2nd millennium BC Nineveh became part of the Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1809–1775 BC), Amorite ruler of Ekallatum. It became a center of worship of Ishtar.\n\nLate Bronze\nMitanni period\nThe goddess's statue was sent to Pharaoh Amenhotep III of Egypt in the 14th century BC, by orders of the king Tushratta of Mitanni. Nineveh became one of Mitanni's vassals for half a century until the early 14th century BC.\n\nMiddle Assyrian period\nThe Assyrian king Ashur-uballit I reclaimed it in 1365 BC while overthrowing the Mitanni Empire and creating the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BC).\nThere is a large body of evidence to show that Assyrian monarchs built extensively in Nineveh during the late 3rd and 2nd millennia BC; it appears to have been originally an \"Assyrian provincial town\". Later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the high city include the Middle Assyrian Empire kings Shalmaneser I (1274–1245 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1114–1076 BC), both of whom were active builders in Assur (Ashur).\n\nIron Age\nNeo-Assyrian period\nDuring the Neo-Assyrian Empire, particularly from the time of Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883–859 BC) onward, there was considerable architectural expansion. Successive monarchs such as Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal maintained and founded new palaces, as well as temples to Sîn, Ashur, Nergal, Shamash, Ninurta, Ishtar, Tammuz, Nisroch and Nabu.\nThe Hebrew Book of Jonah, which was most likely written between 793 and 758 BC, is an account of the city's repentance and Jehovah's mercy which prevented destruction.\n\nSennacherib's development of Nineveh\nIt was Sennacherib who made Nineveh a truly influential city (c. 700 BC), as he laid out new streets and squares, and built within it the South West Palace, or \"palace without a rival\", the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about 503 by 242 metres (1,650 ft × 794 ft). It had at least 80 rooms, many of which were lined with sculpture. A large number of cuneiform tablets were found in the palace. The solid foundation was made out of limestone blocks and mud bricks; it was 22 metres (72 ft) tall. In total, the foundation is made of roughly 2,680,000 cubic metres (3,505,308 cu yd) of brick (approximately 160 million bricks). The walls on top, made out of mud brick, were an additional 20 metres (66 ft) tall.\nSome of the principal doorways were flanked by colossal stone lamassu door figures weighing up to 30,000 kilograms (30 t); these were winged Mesopotamian lions or bulls, with human heads. These were transported 50 kilometres (31 mi) from quarries at Balatai, and they had to be lifted up 20 metres (66 ft) once they arrived at the site, presumably by a ramp. There are also 3,000 metres (9,843 ft) of stone Assyrian palace reliefs, that include pictorial records documenting every construction step including carving the statues and transporting them on a barge. One picture shows 44 men towing a colossal statue. The carving shows three men directing the operation while standing on the Colossus. Once the statues arrived at their destination, the final carving was done. Most of the statues weigh between 9,000 and 27,000 kilograms (19,842 and 59,525 lb).\nThe stone carvings in the walls include many battle scenes, impalings and scenes showing Sennacherib's men parading the spoils of war before him. The inscriptions boasted of his conquests: he wrote of Babylon: \"Its inhabitants, young and old, I did not spare, and with their corpses I filled the streets of the city.\" A full and characteristic set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish in 701 BC; it is the \"finest\" from the reign of Sennacherib, and now in the British Museum. He later wrote about a battle in Lachish: \"And Hezekiah of Judah who had not submitted to my yoke ... him I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city like a caged bird. Earthworks I threw up against him, and anyone coming out of his city gate I made pay for his crime. His cities which I had plundered I had cut off from his land.\"\nAt this time, Nineveh comprised about 7 square kilometres (1,730 acres) of land, and fifteen great gates penetrated its walls. An elaborate system of eighteen canals brought water from the hills to Nineveh, and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by Sennacherib were discovered at Jerwan, about 65 kilometres (40 mi) distant. The enclosed area had more than 100,000 inhabitants (maybe closer to 150,000), about twice as many as Babylon at the time, placing it among the largest settlements worldwide.\nSome scholars such as Stephanie Dalley at Oxford believe that the garden Sennacherib built next to his palace, with its associated irrigation works, was the original Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Dalley's argument is based on a disputation of the traditional placement of the Hanging Gardens attributed to Berossus, together with a combination of literary and archaeological evidence.\n\nAfter Ashurbanipal\nThe greatness of Nineveh was short-lived. In around 627 BC, after the death of its last great king Ashurbanipal, the Neo-Assyrian Empire began to unravel through a series of bitter civil wars between rival claimants for the throne, and in 616 BC Assyria was attacked by its own former vassals, the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. In about 616 BC Kalhu was sacked, the allied forces eventually reached Nineveh, besieging and sacking the city in 612 BC, following bitter house-to-house fighting, after which it was razed. Most of the people in the city who could not escape to the last Assyrian strongholds in the north and west were either massacred or deported out of the city and into the countryside where they founded new settlements. Many unburied skeletons were found by the archaeologists at the site. The Assyrian Empire then came to an end by 605 BC, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its colonies between themselves.\nIt is not clear whether Nineveh came under the rule of the Medes or the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 612. The Babylonian Chronicles concerning the Fall of Nineveh record that Nineveh was \"turned into mounds and heaps\", but this is literary hyperbole. The complete destruction of Nineveh has traditionally been seen as confirmed by the Hebrew Book of Ezekiel and the Greek Retreat of the Ten Thousand of Xenophon (d. 354 BC). There are no later cuneiform tablets in Akkadian from Nineveh. Although devastated in 612 BC, the city was not completely abandoned. Yet, to the Greek historians Ctesias and Herodotus (c. 400 BC), Nineveh was a thing of the past; and when Xenophon passed the place in the 4th century BC he described it as abandoned.\n\nPersian period\nThe earliest piece of written evidence for the persistence of Nineveh as a settlement is possibly the Cyrus Cylinder of 539/538 BC, but the reading of this is disputed. If correctly read as Nineveh, it indicates that Cyrus the Great restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh and probably encouraged resettlement. A number of cuneiform Elamite tablets have been found at Nineveh. They probably date from the time of the revival of Elam in the century following the collapse of Assyria.\nArchaeologically, there is evidence of repairs at the temple of Nabu after 612 BC and for the continued use of Sennacherib's palace. There is evidence of syncretic Hellenistic cults. A statue of Hermes has been found and a Greek inscription attached to a shrine of the Sebitti. A statue of Herakles Epitrapezios dated to the 2nd century AD has also been found.\n\nClassical period\nThe city was actively resettled under the Seleucid Empire. There is evidence of more changes in Sennacherib's palace under the Parthian Empire. The Parthians also established a municipal mint at Nineveh coining in bronze. According to Tacitus, in AD 50 Meherdates, a claimant to the Parthian throne with Roman support, took Nineveh.\n\nLate Antiquity\nBy Late Antiquity, Nineveh was restricted to the east bank of the Tigris and the west bank was uninhabited. Under the Sasanian Empire, Nineveh was not an administrative centre. By the 2nd century AD there were Christians present and by 554 it was a bishopric of the Church of the East. King Khosrow II (591–628) built a fortress on the west bank, and two Christian monasteries were constructed around 570 and 595. This growing settlement was not called Mosul until after the Arab conquests. It may have been called Hesnā ʿEbrāyē (Jews' Fort).\nIn 627, the city was the site of the Battle of Nineveh between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sasanians. In 641, it was conquered by the Arabs, who built a mosque on the west bank and turned it into an administrative centre. Under the Umayyad dynasty, Mosul eclipsed Nineveh, which was reduced to a Christian suburb with limited new construction. By the 13th century, Nineveh was mostly ruins and was subsequently absorbed into Mosul. A church was converted into a Muslim shrine to the prophet Jonah, which continued to attract pilgrims until its destruction by ISIL in 2014. In late Ottoman times, the ashlar masonry of the North Palace of Ashurbanipal was quarried to make for the pilons of the Old Bridge over the Tigris. The modern city of Mosul is occasionally referred to as Nineveh, such as during the operation to retake Mosul in 2016–17.\n\nBiblical Nineveh\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Nineveh is first mentioned in Genesis 10:11: \"Ashur left that land, and built Nineveh\". Some modern English translations interpret \"Ashur\" in the Hebrew of this verse as the country \"Assyria\" rather than a person, thus making Nimrod, rather than Ashur, the founder of Nineveh. The discovery of the fifteen Jubilees texts found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls has since shown that, according to the Jewish sects of Qumran, Genesis 10:11 affirms the apportionment of Nineveh to Ashur.\n\nAccording to Isaiah 37:37–38 Nineveh was also the place where Sennacherib died at the hands of his two sons, who then fled to Ararat. The book of the minor prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against Nineveh. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold in Nahum 1:14 and Nahum 3:19. In Nahum 2:6–11 its end was fortold to be strange, sudden, and tragic. According to Isaiah 10:5–19 it was God's doing, his judgment on Assyria's pride. In fulfillment of prophecy, God made \"an utter end of the place\". It became a \"desolation\". In Zephaniah 2:13–15 the minor prophet Zephaniah also predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. Nineveh is also the setting of the Book of Tobit.\nThe Book of Jonah (Jonah 3:3 and Jonah 4:11), set in the days of the Assyrian Empire, describes it as an \"exceedingly great city of three days' journey in breadth\", whose population at that time is given as \"more than 120,000\". Genesis 10:11–12 lists four cities \"Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen\", ambiguously stating that either Resen or Calah is \"the great city\". The ruins of Kuyunjiq, Nimrud, Karamlesh and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrilateral. The ruins of the \"great city\" Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The description of Nineveh in Jonah likely was a reference to greater Nineveh, including the surrounding cities of Rehoboth, Calah and Resen The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states he is showing mercy for the population who, according to Jonah 4:11), are ignorant of the difference between right and wrong (\"who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand\" and mercy for the beasts in the city.\nNineveh's repentance and salvation from evil can be found in the Hebrew Tanakh, also known as the Old Testament, and referred to in Matthew 12:41 and Luke 11:32 and Muslim Quran. To this day, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox churches commemorate the three days Jonah spent inside the fish during the Fast of Nineveh. Some Christians observe this holiday fast by refraining from food and drink, with churches encouraging followers to refrain from dairy products, fish and other meats.\n\nArchaeology\nCarsten Niebuhr recorded its location during the 1761–1767 Danish expedition. Niebuhr wrote afterwards that \"I did not learn that I was at so remarkable a spot, till near the river. Then they showed me a village on a great hill, which they call Nunia, and a mosque, in which the prophet Jonah was buried. Another hill in this district is called Kalla Nunia, or the Castle of Nineveh. On that lies a village Koindsjug.\" In 1820 the site was explored and described by archaeologist Claudius Rich. In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-Émile Botta, began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. While at Tell Kuyunjiq he had little success, the locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the 20 km far-away mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.\n\nIn 1847 the young British diplomat Austen Henry Layard explored the ruins. Layard did not use modern archaeological methods; his stated goal was \"to obtain the largest possible number of well preserved objects of art at the least possible outlay of time and money\". In the Kuyunjiq mound, Layard rediscovered in 1849 the lost palace of Sennacherib with its 71 rooms and colossal bas-reliefs. He also unearthed the palace and famous library of Ashurbanipal with 22,000 cuneiform clay tablets. Most of Layard's material was sent to the British Museum, but some was dispersed elsewhere: two large pieces were given to Lady Charlotte Guest and these eventually found their way to the Metropolitan Museum.\nThe work of exploration was carried on by Hormuzd Rassam, George Smith and others, and a vast treasury of specimens of Assyria was incrementally exhumed for European museums. Palace after palace was discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs.\nThe mound of Tell Kuyunjiq was excavated again by the archaeologists of the British Museum, led by Leonard William King, between 1902 and 1904. Their efforts concentrated on the site of the Temple of Nabu where another cuneiform library was supposed to exist. However, no such library was ever found: most likely, it had been destroyed by the activities of later residents.\nThe excavations started again in 1927, under the direction of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King's expeditions. Some works were carried out outside Kuyunjiq, for instance on the mound of Tell Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was almost perfect.\nAfter the Second World War, several excavations were carried out by Iraqi archaeologists. From 1951 to 1958, Mohammed Ali Mustafa worked the site. The work was continued from 1967 through 1971 by Tariq Madhloom. Some additional excavation occurred by Manhal Jabur from the early 1970s to 1987. For the most part, these digs focused on Tell Nebi Yunus.\nThe British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor David Stronach of the University of California, Berkeley conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege. The excavation reports are in progress.\nAfter Mosul’s liberation from the control of the Islamic State (IS), Peter A. Miglus, University of Heidelberg, established a rescue project in 2018, exploring and documenting the intrusive IS tunnels in the Assyrian Military Palace that is located below the destroyed Mosque of the prophet Jonah on Tell Nebi Yunus. Archaeological excavations have been conducted since 2019. Subsequently, an extensive research project, first under the direction of Stefan M. Maul and now of Aaron Schmidt, University of Heidelberg, developed, focusing also on other areas of Nineveh. At Tell Kuyunjiq, activities started in 2021 with rescue and restoration measures for the destroyed reliefs in the throne room wing of the Southwest Palace. Excavations in the North Palace commenced in 2022. Since 2023, work has also been conducted at the Nergal Gate, which was bulldozed by IS. In the lower town, geophysical surveys were carried out north of Kuyunjiq in 2021 and 2023 in preparation of future research on residential areas.\nAn Iraqi–Italian Archaeological Expedition by the Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna and the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH), led by Nicolò Marchetti, began (with five campaigns having taken place between 2019 and 2023) a project aiming at the excavation, conservation and public presentation of the lower town of Nineveh. Work was carried out in nineteen excavation areas, from the Adad Gate – now completely repaired (after removing hundreds of tons of debris from ISIL's 2016 destructions), explored and protected with a new roof – deep into the Nebi Yunus town. In a few areas a thick later stratigraphy was encountered, but the late 7th century BC stratum was reached everywhere (actually in two areas in the pre-Sennacherib lower town the excavations already exposed older strata, up to the 11th century BC until now, aiming in the future at exploring the first settlement therein). In October 2023 an archaeological park was inaugurated at the site.\nSince 2024, an expedition led by Tim Harrison of the ISAC at the University of Chicago has taken over from the University of Bologna the investigation of the eastern lower town at Nineveh.\n\nArchaeological remains\nThe site is marked by two large mounds, Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus \"Prophet Jonah\", and the remains of the city walls (about 12 kilometres (7 mi) in circumference), enclosing a vast lower town extensively encroached by modern buildings. The Neo-Assyrian levels of Kuyunjiq have been extensively explored. The other mound, Nabī Yūnus, has not been as extensively explored because there was an Arab Muslim shrine dedicated to that prophet on the site. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State destroyed the shrine as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed \"un-Islamic\", but also to loot that site through tunneling.\nThe ruin mound of Tell Kuyunjiq rises about 20 metres (66 ft) above the surrounding plain of the ancient city. It is quite broad, measuring about 800 by 500 metres (2,625 ft × 1,640 ft). Its upper layers have been extensively excavated, and several Neo-Assyrian palaces and temples have been found there. A deep sounding by Max Mallowan revealed evidence of habitation as early as the 6th millennium BC. Today, there is little evidence of these old excavations other than weathered pits and earth piles. In 1990, the only Assyrian remains visible were those of the entry court and the first few chambers of the Palace of Sennacherib. Since that time, the palace chambers have received significant damage by looters and by the removal of the protective roof. Portions of relief sculptures that were in the palace chambers in 1990 were seen on the antiquities market by 1996. Photographs of the chambers made in 2003 show that many of the fine relief sculptures there have been reduced to piles of rubble and a conservation effort ensued. In 2016 Sennacherib's throne room was bulldozed by Daesh and the sculpted fragments were left exposed until 2022.\n\nTell Nebi Yunus is located about 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) south of Kuyunjiq and is the secondary ruin mound at Nineveh. On the basis of texts of Sennacherib, the site has traditionally been identified as the \"armory\" of Nineveh, and a gate and pavements excavated by Iraqis in 1954 have been considered to be part of the \"armory\" complex. Excavations in 1990 revealed a monumental entryway consisting of a number of large inscribed orthostats and \"bull-man\" sculptures, some apparently unfinished. Following the liberation of Mosul, the tunnels under Tell Nebi Yunus were explored in 2018, in which a 3000-year-old palace was discovered, including a pair of reliefs, each showing a row of women, along with reliefs of lamassu.\n\nThe ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700 BC. About 12 km in length, the wall system consisted of an ashlar stone retaining wall about 6 metres (20 ft) high surmounted by a mudbrick wall about 10 metres (33 ft) high and 15 metres (49 ft) thick. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every 18 metres (59 ft). The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step merlons.\nSix of the gateways have been explored to some extent by archaeologists (besides the possible Sin Gate at the north-west end of the site):\n\nMashki Gate Masqi Gate (Arabic: بوابة مسقي Derived from the passive participle of سَقَى saqā, \"to give (sb) a drink, to water, to irrigate\") was perhaps used to take livestock to water from the Tigris which currently flows about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 mi) to the west. It has been reconstructed in fortified mudbrick to the height of the top of the vaulted passageway. The Assyrian original may have been plastered and ornamented. It was bulldozed along with the Nergal and Adad Gates during IS occupation. During the restoration project, seven damaged alabaster carvings from the time of Sennacherib were found at the gate in 2022.\nNergal Gate: Named for the god Nergal, it may have been used for some ceremonial purpose, as it is the only known gate flanked by stone sculptures of winged bull-men (lamassu). The reconstruction is conjectural, as the gate was excavated by Layard in the mid-19th century and reconstructed in the mid-20th century. The lamassu on this gate were defaced with a jackhammer by IS forces and the gate was utterly destroyed.\nAdad Gate: Named for the god Adad. A roofing above it was begun in the late 1960s by Iraqis but was not completed. The result was a mixture of concrete and eroding mudbrick, which nonetheless does give some idea of the original structure. The excavator left some features unexcavated, allowing a view of the original Assyrian construction. The original brickwork of the outer vaulted passageway was well exposed, as was the entrance of the vaulted stairway to the upper levels. The actions of Nineveh's last defenders could be seen in the hastily built mudbrick construction which narrowed the passageway from 4 to 2 metres (13 to 7 ft). Around April 13, 2016, IS demolished both the gate and the adjacent wall by flattening them with a bulldozer. It has been reexcavated (including a 7 m deep stair-well), conservated and presented to the public by the Iraqi-Italian expedition between 2019 and 2023.\nShamash Gate: Named for the sun god Shamash, it opens to the road to Erbil. It was excavated by Layard in the 19th century. The stone retaining wall and part of the mudbrick structure were reconstructed in the 1960s. The mudbrick reconstruction has deteriorated significantly. The stone wall projects outward about 20 metres (66 ft) from the line of main wall for a width of about 70 metres (230 ft). It is the only gate with such a significant projection. The mound of its remains towers above the surrounding terrain. Its size and design suggest it was the most important gate in Neo-Assyrian times. It is now being excavated by the University of Chicago expedition.\nHalzi Gate: Near the south end of the eastern city wall. Exploratory excavations were undertaken here by the University of California, Berkeley expedition of 1989–1990 and again in 2022 and 2023 by the Iraqi-Italian Expedition. There is an outward projection of the city wall, though not as pronounced as at the Shamash Gate. The entry passage had been narrowed with mudbrick to about 2 metres (7 ft) as at the Adad Gate. Human remains from the final battle of Nineveh were found in the passageway. Located in the eastern wall, it is the southernmost and largest of all the remaining gates of ancient Nineveh.\nA new gate has been discovered in 2021 to the north of the Shamash Gate and south of the Khosr river (in the area labeled as N by the Iraqi-Italian expedition), next to a spectacular water tunnel running for 42 m under the 31m-thick city wall (area G, excavated in 2020 and 2021).\n\nThreats to the site\nThe site of Nineveh is exposed to decay of its reliefs by a lack of proper protective roofing, vandalism and looting holes dug into chamber floors. Future preservation is further compromised by the site's proximity to expanding suburbs.\nThe ailing Mosul Dam is a persistent threat to Nineveh as well as the city of Mosul. This is in no small part due to years of disrepair (in 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cited it as the most dangerous dam in the world), the cancellation of a second dam project in the 1980s to act as flood relief in case of failure, and occupation by ISIL in 2014 resulting in fleeing workers and stolen equipment. If the dam fails, the entire site could be under as much as 45 feet (14 m) of water.\nA major threat to Nineveh has been deliberate human actions by ISIL or Daesh, which occupied the area between 2014 and 2017. In early 2015, they first announced their intention to destroy the walls of Nineveh if the Iraqis tried to liberate the city,  and they also threatened the destruction of archaeological heritage and artifacts. On February 26, 2015, video footage shows IS smashing statues and artifacts at the Mosul Museum. They are believed to have plundered others to sell overseas. The items were mostly from the Assyrian exhibit, which Daesh declared blasphemous and idolatrous. There were 300 items remaining in the museum out of a total of 1,900, with the other 1,600 being taken to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad for security reasons prior to the 2014 Fall of Mosul. Some of the artifacts sold and/or destroyed were from Nineveh. Just a few days after the destruction of the museum pieces, Daesh terrorists demolished parts of three other major UNESCO world heritage sites, Khorsabad, Nimrud and Hatra. In 2016, Daesh effectively destroyed the Adad Gate (along with the adjoining northern city walls, now cleared by the Iraqi-Italian expedition thanks to the support of the Kaplan Fund), as well as the Mashki Gate (along with the eastern fortifications. The Mashki Gate is in the process of being restored). Daesh also called for intensive new housing in the Kuyunjiq part and opened a large road across the southern part of the site (currently known as Al Asady Road).\nAfter the cultural destruction and between 2014-2019, international efforts by archeologists began recording, evaluating and monitoring the damage and destruction inflicted on sensitive archaeological contexts in Nineveh, using satellite-based remote sensing. The results found that a few high-profile acts of deliberate vandalism were accompanied by much more extensive damage caused by construction and rubbish dumping extending across substantial parts of the site.\nThanks to the activities of the Iraqi-Italian expedition, an archaeological park has been opened at Kuyunjiq since 2023: tourists enter from the Adad gate, subsequently visiting the small Neo-Assyrian palace where the cuneiform library was discovered in 2021, and may then relax in the VW Foundation-funded KALAM mudbrick information center nearby. The site is still endangered, however, with dumping of debris, illegal settlements and economic activities (such as illegal generators for electricity, pipe companies etc.) as the main threats.\n\nRogation of the Ninevites (Nineveh's Wish)\nMembers of the Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East and Saint Thomas Christians of the Syro-Malabar Church observe a fast called Ba'uta d-Ninwe (ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܐ) which means Nineveh's Prayer. Copts and Ethiopian Orthodox also maintain this fast.\n\nIn popular culture\nEnglish Romantic poet Edwin Atherstone wrote an epic titled The Fall of Nineveh. The work tells of an uprising against king Sardanapalus by all the nations that were dominated by the Assyrian Empire. He is a great criminal who had one hundred prisoners of war executed. After a long struggle, the town is conquered by Median and Babylonian troops, led by prince Arbaces and priest Belesis. The king then sets his own palace on fire and dies inside together with all his concubines.\n\nAtherstone's friend, artist John Martin, created a painting of the same name inspired by the poem. English poet John Masefield's well-known, fanciful 1903 poem Cargoes mentions Nineveh in its first line. Nineveh is also mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's 1897 poem Recessional and Arthur O'Shaughnessy's 1873 poem Ode.\n\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nDestruction of cultural heritage by the Islamic State\nHistorical urban community sizes\nIsaac of Nineveh\nList of megalithic sites\nNanshe\nQurnah disaster\nShort chronology timeline\nTel Keppe\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Easton, Matthew George (1897). \"Nineveh\".

      "summary": "Nineveh was an ancient Near Eastern city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of an Assyrian Christian bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 14th century AD after the massacres and dispersal of Assyrian Christians by Timur.\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, site of a shrine to Jonah. According to the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Jonah was a prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large numbers of Assyrian sculptures and other artifacts have been excavated from the ruins of Nineveh, and are now located in museums around the world.\n\nThe location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.",

      "content": "Ninive (en akkadien Ninu(w)a ; en arabe نينوه, Naynuwa ; en araméen ܢܝܢܘܐ ; en hébreu נינוה, Nīnwē) est une ancienne ville de l'Assyrie, dans le Nord de la Mésopotamie. Elle se situait sur la rive est (gauche) du Tigre, au confluent du Khosr (ou Khoser, Koussour), à un emplacement aujourd'hui localisé dans les faubourgs de la ville moderne de Mossoul, en Irak, dont le centre se trouve de l'autre côté du fleuve. Les deux sites principaux de la cité sont les collines (les « tells ») de Kuyunjik et de Nebī Yūnus.\nNinive est l'une des plus anciennes cités de Mésopotamie. Elle était un important carrefour de routes commerciales traversant le Tigre. Elle occupait une position stratégique sur la grande route entre la mer Méditerranée et le plateau Iranien, ce qui lui a apporté la prospérité, de sorte qu'elle est devenue l'une des plus grandes cités de toute la région. Elle doit sa plus grande expansion urbaine au choix du roi assyrien Sennacherib d'en faire la capitale de son grand empire au début du VIIe siècle av. J.-C. Ninive est alors entourée de remparts de briques sur une longueur de 12 km. L'espace total de la cité couvrait 750 hectares à son apogée. L'ensemble de ce vaste espace est aujourd'hui une superposition de ruines recouvertes à certains endroits par les nouvelles banlieues actuelles de la ville de Mossoul. Depuis 2014 et la prise de contrôle de Mossoul par l'organisation terroriste État islamique, les ruines de Ninive ont fait l'objet d'importantes destructions.\nLe site de Kuyunjik occupe une place importante dans la redécouverte du Proche-Orient ancien au milieu du XIXe siècle par les archéologues qui mettent au jour ses palais et leurs bas-reliefs, ainsi que par les milliers de tablettes cunéiformes qui y ont été exhumées dès les premiers chantiers de fouilles et ont permis la naissance de la discipline assyriologique. Ce même tell présente la séquence archéologique la plus longue de la Mésopotamie, depuis les premières traces d'habitations au VIe millénaire av. J.-C. jusqu'aux dernières vers les XIIIe – XIVe siècles apr. J.-C. Les fouilles de Ninive ont donc livré une partie substantielle des sources des connaissances actuelles sur l'Empire assyrien et, plus largement, sur la culture de la Mésopotamie antique.\n\nSituation et site\nSur le confluent du grand fleuve le Tigre (assyrien Idiglat), et du Khosr (Huṣur), Ninive est située au sud de l'actuel Kurdistan, dans une vallée fertile où l'agriculture sèche est possible, ainsi que l'élevage. Sa situation est suffisamment en retrait des montagnes pour la protéger des incursions de peuples montagnards, tout en la plaçant à proximité de deux routes commerciales importantes dès les temps les plus anciens : une première qui suit sur un axe nord-sud le cours du Tigre et relie le Taurus et la plaine mésopotamienne, et une seconde de direction est-ouest qui traverse le Tigre à proximité de Ninive et poursuit sa route vers l'ouest en direction du cours moyen de l'Euphrate, puis vers la Mer Méditerranée.\nLe site de Ninive, qui couvrait plus de 750 hectares entourés par une muraille à son apogée au VIIe siècle av. J.-C., est coupé en deux par le Khosr d'est en ouest, alors que le Tigre coule à l'ouest en dehors de l'espace urbain. Le tell le plus important du site, Kuyunjik, se situe au nord du Khosr qu'il surplombe et qui effectue une boucle sur son flanc oriental. L'autre tell, Nebi Yunus, est plus petit, et est situé un peu plus d'un kilomètre au sud. L'extension de la ville aux époques historiques se poursuit en contrebas, dans la ville basse, qui s'étend vers l'est des deux tells.\n\nRedécouverte et fouilles\nPremiers chantiers à Kuyunjik au milieu du XIXe siècle\nLe site du tell de Kuyunjik, situé juste en face de la ville actuelle de Mossoul, est depuis longtemps connu pour être l'emplacement probable de l'antique Ninive. C'est pour cette raison que lorsque l'explorateur anglais Claudius James Rich se rendit en Irak à la recherche des anciens sites de la Mésopotamie en 1820, il fit une halte en ce lieu, dont il dressa les plans, découvrant au passage quelques sculptures. C'est le premier Européen à avoir retrouvé les traces de Ninive, sans faire alors de fouilles. Les premières prospections dans Kuyunjik furent peu fructueuses et il fallut du temps avant de confirmer l'identification de ce tell comme étant l'acropole de l'ancienne grande capitale assyrienne. La redécouverte de Ninive fut l'objectif principal des pionniers de l'archéologie du Proche-Orient ancien lorsqu'ils commencèrent à fouiller les sites de l'ancienne Assyrie, en raison de son prestige et de celui des grands rois assyriens dont les noms étaient encore connus par une grande partie de la population de pays comme la Grande-Bretagne ou la France, en raison du poids important de la culture biblique, ce qui explique pourquoi leurs découvertes furent très suivies. Proches de la grande ville de Mossoul et situés dans un lieu nommé « Ninuwa » par la population locale qui gardait le souvenir de l'ancienne capitale assyrienne, les tells de Nebi Yunus (site qu'il s'avéra impossible de fouiller en raison de son caractère sacré) puis de Kuyunjik furent logiquement, en 1842, la première destination du consul français local, Paul-Émile Botta, lorsqu'il tenta de retrouver Ninive. Alors qu'il se trouvait au bon emplacement, ses trouvailles furent maigres et il douta d'être dans le site désiré ; il se déplaça donc de quelques kilomètres plus au nord, à Khorsabad, où les ruines étaient plus apparentes. Il dégagea des monuments dont il pensa quelque temps qu'il s'agissait bien des ruines de Ninive, avant de mettre en évidence le fait qu'il s’agissait de Dur-Sharrukin.\nPeu de temps après, en 1847, le britannique A. H. Layard, qui travaillait déjà dans le site de Nimrud, qu'il pensait de son côté être Ninive et qui était en réalité Kalkhu, supervisa les fouilles de Kuyunjik après ses résultats concluants dans son premier site. Après avoir révélé à Londres ses premières découvertes (effectuées surtout à Nimrud), il revint en 1849 à Kuyunjik pour y effectuer des fouilles plus ambitieuses, avec son assistant Hormuzd Rassam. Ils découvrirent le palais de Sennacherib et des centaines de mètres de reliefs sculptés, notamment ceux relatant la prise de Lakish, et une campagne d'Assurbanipal en Élam, ainsi que le premier lot de tablettes cunéiformes de Ninive, comprenant une partie de la « Bibliothèque d'Assurbanipal » et des archives des rois assyriens. Ces trouvailles furent envoyées au British Museum, où elles se trouvent actuellement. Avec ces découvertes, il devint progressivement évident que le site de Kuyunjik correspondait à l'antique Ninive, les autres capitales assyriennes ayant également été identifiées dans ces mêmes années grâce au début du déchiffrement de l'akkadien cunéiforme.\n\nLa poursuite des fouilles par les Britanniques\nLayard quitta par la suite les chantiers de fouilles de Mésopotamie pour se lancer dans une carrière de diplomate, et Henry Rawlinson pris les commandes des expéditions britanniques dans la région. Ce dernier laissa les Français explorer la partie nord du tell de Kuyunjik, alors que le reste était attribué à Rassam, qui s'accommodait peu de cette situation. Il fouilla en secret la partie nord du tell en décembre 1853 et trouva une partie du palais nord d'Assurbanipal, où furent mis au jour de nouveaux bas-reliefs, notamment les scènes de chasse au lion de ce roi, ses campagnes contre l'Elam et les Arabes, puis la deuxième partie des tablettes de la Bibliothèque d'Assurbanipal et des archives royales. Ces trouvailles furent donc envoyées à Londres au nez et à la barbe des archéologues français, qui en gardèrent une profonde rancœur contre Rassam. En 1854, le chantier britannique fut fermé faute de crédits. William Kenneth Loftus reprit ensuite les fouilles du palais d'Assurbanipal d'où les Français avaient été évincés à la suite des découvertes de Rassam et trouva d'autres bas-reliefs. Ses fouilles sont mal connues car elles ont été publiées plus d'un siècle plus tard. Les bas-reliefs découverts à ce moment, ainsi que d'autres bas-reliefs de Ninive laissés par Rawlinson aux Français ou vendus au musée de Berlin furent perdus lors d'un naufrage sur le Chatt-el-Arab en mai 1855, accident qui survint à la suite d'une attaque d'un convoi fluvial dirigé par les Français qui y transportaient aussi une grande partie de sculptures provenant de Khorsabad (naufrage de Gournah).\nD'autres campagnes de fouilles furent entreprises par des Britanniques après cet événement dramatique. Le philologue George Smith alors en poste de 1873 à 1874, avait traduit en 1872 à partir des premières tablettes ramenées de Ninive un récit relatant une partie du mythe du Déluge issu de l’Épopée de Gilgamesh et qui eut un grand retentissement en démontrant que la Bible s'était inspirée d'un texte plus ancien. Smith fut financé par le Daily Telegraph pour retrouver une partie manquante du récit du Déluge, entreprise rapidement couronnée de succès. Il fut emporté peu après par une maladie contractée dans le Nord de l'Irak. Hormuzd Rassam fouilla à nouveau le site de 1878 à 1882. E. A. Wallis Budge dirigea également des campagnes après 1885. À Londres, au British Museum qui dirigeait désormais seul les fouilles du site, les savants s'attelaient alors à traduire les tablettes exhumées et qui permettraient de redécouvrir la culture de la Mésopotamie ancienne et une partie de son histoire. Rawlinson confia à Carl Bezold, assyriologue allemand, le soin d'organiser le classement des tablettes de Ninive. Ce dernier publia de 1889 à 1899 un catalogue en cinq volumes de près de 15 000 tablettes ou fragments, qui a depuis fait l'objet de suppléments à la suite d'autres trouvailles de tablettes dans le site, ou après la redécouverte d'autres qui avaient été oubliées dans des caisses du British Museum après les premières fouilles.\nLes fouilles reprennent à Kuyunjik de 1903 à 1905, sous la direction de L. W. King puis de R. Campbell-Thompson. Ils découvrent plus de 850 tablettes, dernier lot important de textes provenant de Ninive à être mis au jour, et s'intéressent aux restes architecturaux, notamment à ceux du temple de Nabû.\nAprès vingt-deux années d'interruption de fouilles, Campbell-Thompson revient à Kuyunjik de 1927 à 1932 pour mener les dernières fouilles britanniques sur place. Les campagnes portèrent à nouveau sur le temple de Nabû, ainsi que sur celui d'Ishtar, mais également sur d'autres constructions isolées. Elles s'intéressaient aux périodes anciennes du tell, précédant la période assyrienne, déjà pressenties lors des campagnes de King. Max Mallowan fut chargé de réaliser un sondage pour établir une stratigraphie précise du tell et dégagea un espace de 20 mètres sur 16, allant jusqu'à 27,5 mètres de profondeur, ce qui ne correspond pas à la plus ancienne occupation du site seulement à la limite à partir de laquelle il devenait dangereux de creuser. Les trouvailles de céramique de ce sondage ainsi que celles effectuées dans d'autres parties du tell permirent de montrer que le site était occupé depuis des périodes très reculées, puisque 22 mètres de couches étaient occupés par les périodes protohistoriques. La chronologie a été précisée par la suite après des découvertes effectuées sur d'autres sites. Les plus anciens objets trouvés par le sondage remontent à la période de Hassuna (v. 5000 av. J.-C.), niveau 1 de la stratigraphie de ce sondage. Mallowan découvrit également des objets des périodes de Gawra et d'Uruk, ainsi que ceux inconnus auparavant d'une culture attestée par le niveau 5 du sondage, et qui prit le nom de « Ninivite V ».\n\nLes fouilles récentes et les menaces pesant sur le site\nÀ partir des années 1950, ce fut le département irakien des Antiquités qui entreprit des fouilles sur Kuyunjik. Les premiers chantiers eurent lieu sous la direction de M. A. Mustafa de 1951 à 1958, qui explora notamment Nebi Yunus. D'autres campagnes furent effectuées dans les décennies suivantes par d'autres archéologues irakiens : en 1967-71, Tariq Madhloom ; en 1980, Manhal Jabur ; en 1987, Abd as-Sattar. Les fouilles de cette période se déplacèrent notamment vers la ville basse, où furent mis au jour plusieurs bâtiments, comme un temple d'époque parthe. Elles explorèrent les murailles et les portes de la ville. Des campagnes de restauration de certaines d'entre elles furent ensuite entreprises.\nL'Université de Californie de Berkeley finança les dernières campagnes de fouilles régulières dans le site de 1987 à 1990, dirigées par David Stronach. Elles s'attachèrent notamment à dégager la porte de Halzi et à réaliser une prospection de la partie nord de la ville basse. Le début de la guerre du Golfe interrompit les fouilles.\nActuellement, l'ancien site de Ninive donne son nom à la région administrative de Mossoul (Ninawa). La croissance de la métropole voisine se fait de plus en plus dans la ville basse. Les deux tells sont un peu mieux préservés face à l'urbanisation. Kuyunjik a fait face à divers dommages, dus notamment au manque d'entretien consécutif aux conflits qui agitent la région, concernant avant tout le palais sud-ouest. Certaines œuvres d'art restées sur place (surtout dans la salle du trône) ont été pillées.\nÀ la suite de la prise de contrôle de la région par les djihadistes de l'État islamique, d'autres menaces pèsent sur les artefacts archéologiques encore présents dans le site de Ninive. C'est ainsi que, le 24 juillet 2014, deux mosquées, dont la mosquée abritant la tombe attribuée à Jonas, ont été détruites à l'explosif. En janvier 2015, plusieurs médias arabes confirment la destruction des murs d'enceinte antiques par le groupe fondamentaliste terroriste. En février 2015, le même groupe détruit à coup de masses et d'outils de chantier électriques un grand nombre de statues et d'œuvres d'art assyriennes dans le musée de la ville. Cette destruction de lieux prestigieux, mise en scène pour les médias, a été dénoncée par l'UNESCO comme étant un « crime de guerre », et s'accompagne d'un commerce illicite des œuvres d'art provenant des sites détruits.\nAprès la fin du contrôle de l’État islamique et la pacification progressive de la région, les archéologues retournent dans le site depuis 2021. Ils comprennent des équipes irakiennes, italiennes, allemandes et américaines qui s'occupent de divers secteurs du site.\n\nHistoire\nOrigines\nGrâce aux avantages de sa situation, un village fondé au VIIe millénaire av. J.-C. sur le tell de Kuyunjik, surplombant alors la confluence des deux cours d'eau locaux, se développa vite et gagna en importance. Un sondage réalisé sous la direction de Max Mallowan en 1931 et 1932 étudia le site jusqu'aux débuts de son occupation, sur le tell de Kuyunjik, et a fait depuis l'objet de nouvelles études. L'occupation la plus ancienne attestée, le niveau 1, remonte à la période de Hassuna, autour de 6500-6000 av. J.-C.\nLe niveau 2 a livré un matériel caractéristique de la Période de Samarra et de celle de Halaf, jusqu'à la seconde moitié du VIe millénaire av. J.-C. Sous la strate suivante, celle d'Obeid (v. 5500-4500 av. J.-C., niveau 3), qui correspond à la fin du Chalcolithique, la région de Ninive connut ses premières influences sud-mésopotamiennes, identifiées sur le site de Tepe Gawra.\n\nPériode d'Uruk\nAu IVe millénaire av. J.-C. (niveau 4), le matériel céramique exhumé à Ninive témoigne du fait que l'influence du sud mésopotamien se faisait de plus en plus forte alors que les types locaux nord mésopotamiens dominaient largement auparavant. Ont ainsi été trouvés des beveled-rim bowls, ou écuelles à bords biseautés, représentatives de la civilisation d'Uruk, ainsi que les premières céramiques réalisées au tour. Il est possible que Ninive fût alors un établissement des « Urukéens », caractéristique de la période d'Uruk, comme Habuba Kabira et Tell Brak en Syrie du Nord. Autre caractéristique de la période, le développement des outils administratifs : les archéologues ont retrouvé à Ninive une bulle d'argile imprimée avec un sceau-cylindre, ainsi qu'un fragment de tablette numérale scellée. L'extension de l'habitat approcherait déjà 40 hectares à Kuyunjik, alors que le nombre d'habitats augmente dans la région qui l'entoure. C'est peut-être de cette période qu'il faut dater un bâtiment voûté en briques crues, dégagé à proximité du temple d'Ishtar par Campbell-Thompson, ce qui serait un témoignage architectural unique de cette période.\n\nNinive V\nLes fouilles des années 1930 sur le tell de Kuyunjik ont identifié au cinquième niveau archéologique une période spécifique, qui a été nommée d'après le site et son niveau : la période de Ninive V, ou « Ninivite V » (v. 3000-2500 av. J.-C.), qui succède à la période d'Uruk et est contemporaine du Dynastique archaïque I de Basse Mésopotamie. Elle est caractérisée dans un premier temps par sa céramique réalisée au tour, décorée de motifs généralement géométriques (parfois animaliers) de couleur brun-rouge sombre sur fond clair ; les vases fermés sans anse à pieds coniques sont une de ses formes les plus courantes. Cette période a été par la suite repérée sur plusieurs sites en Haute Mésopotamie. Elle s'avère être déterminante dans le développement urbain des sites de la région, mais est restée mal connue avant des travaux récents qui ont permis d'en savoir plus à son propos.\nSur le site de Ninive même, le niveau V a été surtout repéré par le sondage de Mallowan, puis par des fouilles au sud-est de Kuyunjik. La cité avait alors une extension importante, et couvrait probablement tout le tell. Une découverte d'objets de cette période dans la ville basse au nord du tell a montré que cette partie-là a également connu une occupation durant le Ninivite V, ce qui est apparemment la première phase d'habitat de la ville basse. Les empreintes de sceaux-cylindres de cette période mises au jour à Kuyunjik semblent indiquer que Ninive faisait des échanges à longue distance avec la Diyala et la Susiane, ce qui confirme le rôle de centre commercial important qu'occupe cette ville dès ses débuts.\n\nFin du IIIe et début du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. : une ville hourrite\nLes derniers siècles du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C., en Mésopotamie, marqués par la domination de deux empires successifs : celui d'Akkad du XXIVe au XXIIe siècle av. J.-C., et celui dit de la troisième dynastie d'Ur (Ur III), au XXIe siècle av. J.-C. Tous les deux étendent leur domination en Mésopotamie du Nord, mais rien n'indique qu'ils ont pu contrôler Ninive. Selon les inscriptions laissées plus tard par Samsi-Addu, le roi Manishtushu d'Akkad aurait construit (ou restauré) le temple de la déesse Ishtar de Ninive, mais aucune inscription de la période akkadienne qui aurait été écrite sur le site même de Ninive n'a été clairement identifiée, les inscriptions de cette époque exhumées à Kuyunjik ayant probablement été transportées là plus tard. Il en va de même pour les artefacts de cette période trouvés sur le site, dont la fameuse tête royale en bronze représentant un souverain d'Akkad non identifié, qui est un des chefs-d'œuvre de l'art de cette période.\nQuant à l'influence de la dynastie d'Ur III, elle n'est pas assurée non plus : trois textes de cette époque retrouvés en Basse Mésopotamie contiennent des allusions à Ninive. Ces textes sont : une offrande faite à la déesse Shaushga (Ishtar) locale, une visite de Tish-atal (nom hourrite), dit « l'homme de Ninive » (qui peut être assimilé à son roi), et une réception d'ambassadeurs ninivites à Ur. Ces textes indiquent deux choses : premièrement, Ninive est une ville de peuplement à majorité hourrite, ethnie arrivée dans la région vers la fin de la période akkadienne et peu après celle-ci. Deuxièmement, il n'y a aucune preuve de domination d'Ur III sur les princes du petit État de Ninive. On ne sait pas si le Tish-atal mentionné ci-dessus est le même que le Tish-atal qui règne à Urkesh vers la même époque, ce qui en ferait alors un personnage important.\nLes trouvailles archéologiques pour les derniers siècles du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. sont maigres et concentrées à Kuyunjik. Il n'y a aucune preuve archéologique de construction d'un temple par un roi d'Akkad. On a néanmoins identifié un fragment de muraille sur en bordure orientale du tell de Kuyunjik, ce qui constitue la plus ancienne attestation d'une fortification à Ninive. L'habitat s'étend alors probablement sur tout le tell, mais rien n'indique qu'il y a encore une occupation dans la ville basse.\nAu début du XVIIIe siècle av. J.-C., les textes de Mari montrent que Ninive (alors appelée Ninet), se trouve bien dans un pays peuplé en majorité de Hourrites et qu'elle fait partie du royaume de la ville, non localisée, de Nurrugûm qui s'étend le long du Tigre, dont elle est le principal centre religieux. Le royaume finit par être l'objet des ambitions du roi Samsi-Addu d'Ekallatum, qui constitue un Royaume de Haute-Mésopotamie et étend ses ambitions vers la région du haut Tigre. Il réussit à s'emparer de Nurrugûm vers 1780, et réside un temps à Ninive même, sans doute pour des motifs religieux. Samsi-Addu entreprend rapidement des travaux dans la ville et restaure le temple principal de la ville, celui de la déesse Ishtar (nommée Shaushga en hourrite), ce qu'apprend une inscription de fondation déjà évoquée, dans laquelle il se présente comme le successeur de l'œuvre du roi Manishtushu d'Akkad. De cette période datent quelques autres inscriptions royales et des tablettes cunéiformes, des lettres et des textes littéraires, dont des possibles fragments de l'Épopée de Gilgamesh. Peu après l'effondrement du royaume de Samsi-Addu, c'est Hammurabi de Babylone qui étend apparemment son autorité sur Ninive : Ishtar de Ninive et son temple (appelé É.MÈŠ.MÈŠ) sont mentionnés dans le prologue du Code de Hammurabi, aux côtés des autres grandes villes du royaume. \nLa domination babylonienne ne dépasse pas la fin du XVIIIe siècle av. J.-C. et la suite de l'histoire de Ninive dans la première moitié du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. est mal connue. D'après un texte bilingue écrit en hourrite et en hittite retrouvé à Boğazkale, l'ancienne capitale hittite, Hattusha, un roi hourrite du nom de Pizikarra aurait régné à Ninive vers 1600 av. J.-C. et aurait eu une puissance suffisante pour détruire la cité d'Ebla en Syrie du Nord. Il aurait également fait alliance avec le roi hittite Mursili Ier, ce qui aurait permis d'épargner Ninive lors de l'expédition menée par celui-ci vers la Basse Mésopotamie peu après et qui aboutit au sac de Babylone. Un souverain de la Liste royale assyrienne, Shu-Ninua, qui aurait régné sur Assur vers cette période, a un nom comportant le terme Ninive, ce qui indique peut-être que les deux villes sont alors liées. En dehors de ces sources extérieures à la ville, la présence d'un royaume à Ninive à cette période est difficile à évaluer.\nComme toute la Haute Mésopotamie, Ninive est durant le XVe et le début du XIVe siècle av. J.-C. sous le contrôle des souverains du Mittani. Elle apparaît régulièrement dans les sources de cette époque par le biais de sa grande déesse, Ishtar (akkadien)/Shaushga (hourrite) de Ninive. Cette divinité est attestée au sein de listes d'offrandes de la Troisième dynastie d'Ur. Importante durant la première moitié du IIe millénaire, elle dispose d'un rayonnement international dans la seconde moitié de ce même millénaire, puisque le roi mittanien Tushratta, dont elle est la déesse personnelle, envoie sa statue en Égypte, au pharaon Amenhotep III, comme l'avait fait son prédécesseur nommé Artashumara. Cette divinité est également révérée chez les Hittites, en Anatolie.\n\nL'intégration de Ninive dans le royaume assyrien : une importance croissante\nVers le milieu du XIVe siècle av. J.-C., Ninive est incorporée dans le royaume assyrien par Assur-uballit Ier, qui vient de vaincre le royaume du Mittani. Progressivement, l'élément hourrite tend à être supplanté par les Assyriens dans la région. Au XIIIe siècle av. J.-C., les rois Salmanazar Ier et Tukulti-Ninurta Ier rénovent à plusieurs reprises le temple d'Ishtar et semblent y accorder une grande importance, faisant de Ninive la métropole religieuse de leur royaume. Les travaux effectués du temps de Salmanazar surviennent après un séisme qui a causé la destruction de différents bâtiments, ce qui entraîne d'importants chantiers de reconstruction.\nIl semble que le culte d'Ishtar de Ninive prenne une plus grande importance à partir du XIIe siècle av. J.-C. Son temple est restauré par les rois au moins jusqu'au XIe siècle av. J.-C. On connaît aussi par les textes l'existence d'un temple nommé bīt akītu à Ninive, destiné probablement au déroulement d'une fête (akītu) et considérée comme l'une des plus importantes de la tradition mésopotamienne. Salmanazar Ier est le premier roi à établir un palais royal à Ninive et deux autres sont construits sous ses successeurs ; le premier est érigé par Assur-resh-ishi Ier et Teglath-Phalasar Ier, celui de ce dernier ayant été entouré d'un jardin alimenté par un canal dérivé depuis le Khosr. Les restes de ces édifices n'ont pu être identifiés avec certitudes sur le terrain, de même que les niveaux de cette période du temple d'Ishtar. La ville basse est déjà bien développée à cette période et le tell de Nebi Yunus devient sans doute un arsenal.\nSituée au cœur de l'Assyrie, Ninive reste toujours une possession de ses rois dans les temps difficiles qui suivent le XIIe siècle av. J.-C., même lorsque les Araméens réduisent considérablement leurs possessions au début du Ier millénaire av. J.-C. Au début de la période néo-assyrienne (934-609 av. J.-C.), la ville profite du prestige du pays pour s'enrichir et pour gagner en importance ; les souverains assyriens continuent d'y aménager des palais et de restaurer ses temples.\nUn premier changement survient quand Assurnasirpal II (883-859 av. J.-C.) déplace sa capitale d'Assur à Kalkhu, située dans la même vallée fertile que Ninive, au sud de cette dernière. En plus d'un important programme de constructions dans sa nouvelle capitale, ce roi restaure le temple d'Ishtar et y fait construire un palais où il réside souvent au début de son règne. Ses trois successeurs construisent à leur tour un palais à Ninive, le dernier, Adad-nerari III (810-783 av. J.-C.), restaurant également le temple de Nabû. Cette ville sert également de base de départ pour des expéditions menées vers la Syrie ou l'Anatolie, et est de ce fait régulièrement une résidence royale. Durant le VIIIe siècle av. J.-C., plusieurs de ses gouverneurs apparaissent dans les listes d'éponymes dont le nom sert de référence pour dater les années en Assyrie, signe de l'importance de la ville. Sargon II (721-705 av. J.-C.) change à nouveau la capitale du royaume, la déplaçant de Kalkhu à Dur-Sharrukin, fondée pour l'occasion et située quelques kilomètres au nord de Ninive. Il entreprend aussi des constructions importantes à Ninive telles que la restauration du temple d'Ishtar et de sa ziggurat et la construction d'un temple de type bīt akītu.\nD'après les descriptions que donne Sennacherib, le souverain suivant, de l'état de Ninive avant les travaux qu'il y fait réaliser, on peut déduire que l'espace habité de la ville s'étendait alors sur le tell de Kuyunjik, où étaient concentrés plusieurs bâtiments publics et religieux importants, ainsi que le tell de Nebi Yunus et la ville basse au nord de Kuyunjik, où passait probablement un cours d'eau, et qui n'était pas enclose dans un mur. Le nombre de personnes vivant à Ninive à cette période a pu être estimé très approximativement à 15 000.\n\nLa nouvelle capitale de l'Empire assyrien, un gigantesque chantier\nC'est le roi Sennacherib (704-681 av. J.-C.) qui entreprend vers 700 de faire de Ninive la capitale de son puissant empire, qui s'étend de l'Iran occidental à la Méditerranée. Pour cela, il va engager des moyens considérables, dans le but de faire de la ville une métropole d'une dimension bien supérieure à celles voulues par ses prédécesseurs, la plus grande et la plus belle de toutes. En ce sens, Ninive marque l'apogée de la tradition urbanistique assyrienne. En même temps, toute la campagne qui entoure la capitale est réaménagée. Cette œuvre de construction est évoquée dans divers textes relatant ce règne, d'une importance de même niveau que cella des campagnes militaires, et apparaît également dans de nombreux bas-reliefs de son palais royal.\nLe roi Sennacherib commença par faire passer son périmètre de 5 à 12 km, soit une surface d'environ 750 hectares pour environ 150 hectares précédemment. La ville fut étendue en longueur, au-delà du Khosr et vers le sud (cette rivière coupant la ville en deux vers son milieu), pour atteindre 5 kilomètres de long, et en largeur, vers le nord-est, où elle mesure 2 kilomètres. Des murailles puissantes furent bâties et percées de quinze portes. Les rues furent agrandies, et une « voie royale » d'environ 31 mètres de large et bordée de stèles fut percée et devait être préservée à tout prix : quiconque construirait un bâtiment qui empièterait dessus serait empalé. Les constructeurs percèrent également des places et restaurèrent tout ce qui tombait en ruine.\nD'autres aménagements importants furent entrepris pour maîtriser l'eau de la région de Ninive, afin d'améliorer la vie des habitants de la campagne et de la ville, la productivité des campagnes destinées à nourrir l'importante population de cette dernière, ainsi que de créer des espaces d'agrément. Le cours du Khosr fut canalisé, contrôlé par deux nouveaux barrages et son débit fut augmenté par le détournement d'eau venant de la région haute au nord de la ville, amenée par différents ouvrages d'art dont le plus notable est l'aqueduc de Jerwan. Sennacherib fit ensuite identifier tous les points d'eau disponibles autour de Ninive pour augmenter les disponibilités, notamment en saison chaude. Cela a permis d'augmenter la zone cultivée autour de Ninive, d'alimenter de vastes parcs et jardins hors de la ville et à l'intérieur ; tout le paysage de la région entourant Ninive fut donc bouleversé, puisqu'on alla jusqu'à créer des marécages ainsi qu'une sorte de réserve naturelle d'agrément, dans l'espace rural.\nSennacherib concentra son œuvre sur le tell de Kuyunjik, où il édifia le grand « Palais sans rival ». Les récits du roi relatifs à la fondation de cet édifice sont abondants et fournissent de nombreux détails, même s'ils contiennent des incohérences (par exemple, les dimensions de la terrasse du palais diffèrent selon les versions du texte de fondation). Le palais fut construit sur la partie sud-ouest de la citadelle, sur l'emplacement d'un ancien palais qui tombait en ruine à cause de l'érosion provoquée par la rivière Khosr, qui coulait en contrebas. Le vieil édifice fut d'abord rasé, puis le cours de la rivière fut détourné pour pouvoir élargir les puissantes fondations du palais et les relever. Ce programme put être réalisé grâce à l'exploitation d'une nouvelle carrière de pierre destinée à la réalisation des sculptures (notamment à destination de la statuaire des taureaux androcéphales), ainsi que d'une nouvelle forêt de cèdres dans les montagnes, qui permettent de compléter les anciennes régions d'extraction de ces matières premières. Ces trouvailles sont célébrées par Sennacherib comme des miracles voulus par les dieux, qui ainsi marqueraient leur approbation envers son œuvre de construction. La décoration intérieure du palais fut également l'objet de nombreuses attentions et l'occasion de réalisations spectaculaires dont se glorifiait le roi, comme les statues géantes en cuivre et en bronze, les taureaux ailés sculptés, etc. Les autres palais de Kuyunjik furent restaurés, de même que les temples, et le vieil arsenal de Nebi Yunus.\nPour réussir son entreprise, Sennacherib dut donc mobiliser des ressources matérielles énormes venant parfois d'endroits éloignés de son royaume (notamment le bois et les métaux), mais il dut également mobiliser des moyens humains considérables. Une grande partie des travaux sont effectués par des déportés, mais aussi peut-être par des sujets d'Assyrie au titre de corvée. Les récits de construction ne cachent pas le fait que certaines de ces tâches étaient harassantes, notamment l'extraction et le transport de blocs de pierres ou de sculptures monumentales. Il fallut aussi employer en nombre plus réduit des artisans et ouvriers spécialisés, qui pouvaient venir de tout l'empire, mais aussi des maîtres d'œuvre sur lesquels il existe très peu d'informations.\nL'inauguration des nouvelles constructions firent l'objet de fêtes. Quand il eut achevé son « Palais sans rival », Sennacherib invita Assur et les autres grands dieux d'Assyrie (en fait les statues de leurs grands temples) à un banquet somptueux au cours duquel il leur fit des offrandes, servant à assurer la protection divine pour l'édifice. Il décida des fêtes à d'autres occasions, notamment lors de l'achèvement du canal principal, faisant des sacrifices aux dieux pour la postérité de la construction et offrant même à l'occasion des vêtements et objets précieux aux personnes qui avaient participé à sa difficile construction, geste inédit dans les récits de construction assyriens.\n\nLes successeurs de Sennacherib continuèrent à embellir la ville et à restaurer et améliorer certains de ses édifices. Sur le tell de Nebi Yunus, Assarhaddon reconstruisit l'arsenal. À Kuyunjik, Assurbanipal, après avoir occupé dans un premier temps le palais de Sennacherib, restaura un ancien palais déjà réaménagé, le bīt-redūti (« Maison de l'héritier ») : c'est le « Palais nord ».\nL'importance de la population de Ninive à son apogée demeure une question. Si on évalue le nombre d'habitants possibles en fonction de l'espace enclos par les murs, en prenant en compte un taux de 100 habitants par hectare (très approximatif étant donné que tout l'espace n'était pas habité et que d'autres quartiers étaient densément peuplés), on arriverait à approximativement 75 000 habitants.\n\nLa chute de Ninive\nAprès la fin du règne d'Assurbanipal, l'Assyrie décline brutalement et se retrouve menacée en son cœur par les assauts des Babyloniens et des Mèdes. En 614 av. J.-C., les Mèdes, seuls, mènent une campagne en Assyrie, campagne qui voit la chute d'Assur et un premier assaut sur Ninive, qui échoue cependant. Une seconde campagne est menée en 612, par les deux alliés ensemble, avec pour but la prise de Ninive. Le siège dure seulement trois mois, et la ville tombe ; le roi assyrien Sîn-shar-ishkun meurt durant ces combats. La ville est pillée et détruite, événement qui marque la fin de l'empire assyrien.\n\n« La [14e année (612)], le roi d'Akkad (Babylone) rassembla ses troupes [et marcha sur l'Assyrie]. Le roi des Umman-manda (Mèdes) [se rendit] en présence du roi d'Akkad [et le roi d'Akkad et Cyaxare (le roi des Mèdes)] se rencontrèrent à [...]u. Le roi d'Akkad et son armée [traversèrent le Tigre, Cy]axare fit traverser le [Rad]anu et ils firent mouvement le long de la rive du Tigre ; au [mois de Siwan, le ...e jour, ils dressèrent le camp] devant Ninive. Du mois de Siwan au mois d'Ab, pendant 3 mois, [ils (?) ... (et)] ils livrèrent une rude bataille à la ville. Au mois d'Ab, [le ...e jour], ils infligèrent une écrasante [défaite] à un [gr]rand [peuple]. À ce moment mourut Sîn-shar-ishkun, le roi d'Assy[rie .. (?)..]. Ils prirent un important butin dans la ville et dans le temple et [réduisirent] la ville en un monceau de dé[combres]. »\n\n— Extrait d'une chronique babylonienne rapportant la chute de Ninive.\n\nLes fouilles de certaines portes de la cité ont apporté des éléments nouveaux sur le déroulement du siège et en particulier celles de Shamash, d'Adad et de Halzi. Elles témoignent de la préparation des Ninivites au siège, puisque leurs entrées sont rétrécies et que des tours de défense sont sans doute ajoutées à la troisième. Seule la porte d'Adad, au nord, et celle de Halzi, au sud, portent des traces d'attaque. Dans la seconde, on a retrouvé les cadavres d'une douzaine d'individus morts au cours de l'assaut final. Celle de Shamash, proche de la porte de Halzi, n'a en revanche livré aucune trace de combat. Selon D. Stronach, les assaillants auraient porté leurs attaques sur quelques points stratégiques de l'enceinte, aux extrémités nord et sud le cas échéant, pour profiter de la taille de la ville et obliger ainsi les défenseurs à se disperser. Il suppose également que les zones de la muraille bordant le Khosr ont dû faire l'objet d'assauts. Plusieurs traditions (narrées par Diodore de Sicile et dans le Livre de Nahum) rapportent qu'une inondation se serait alors produite, ce qui pourrait indiquer que la rivière a joué un rôle dans la chute de la ville.\n\nPériode post-impériale\nLes trois siècles suivant la chute de l'empire assyrien sont très mal connus, en ce qui concerne la région de l'ancienne Assyrie. Il n'y a en effet quasiment pas de textes provenant de cette région et aucun n'est clairement attesté comme venant de Ninive. La culture matérielle post-assyrienne n'a pas, par conséquent, pu être déterminée.\nEn tant que capitale et plus grande métropole assyrienne, Ninive fut la cible principale de l'assaut final des Babyloniens et des Mèdes en 612 av. J.-C. La ville subit un pillage et des destructions très violentes, même si rien n'indique que sa population fut massivement massacrée ou déportée. Les édifices principaux ont été détruits et quelques-uns sont partiellement réoccupés peu après : le temple de Nabû, une partie du palais Sud-Ouest ainsi qu'une partie à l'est de Kuyunjik, identifiés par les fouilleurs du site comme des niveaux de « squatters », c'est-à-dire de personnes qui réutilisent des pièces et des orthostates pour aménager un habitat dans ces ruines. Les alentours de la ville sont encore habités à l'époque achéménide selon le témoignage de Xénophon, de passage dans la région lors de la retraite des Dix-Mille, vers 400 av. J.-C. Il rapporte dans son Anabase être passé avec son armée aux abords des ruines d'une ville appelée Mespila, couramment identifiée comme étant Ninive, et qui semble inhabitée à ce moment mais qui sert de refuge aux habitants de la campagne environnante du fait de ses murailles restées imposantes.\n\nPériodes hellénistique et partho-romaine : le nouvel essor de Ninive\nL'évolution politique de la Haute Mésopotamie après la chute de l'empire perse est complexe et elle est surtout connue dans les grandes lignes, la situation particulière de Ninive étant mal connue. Elle vit toutefois une reprise et redevient une ville importante au moins à la période de la domination des Parthes. Kuyunjik est apparemment encore habitée, ainsi que la ville basse au nord de Kuyunjik mais aussi au sud du Khosr, où ont été dégagés des bâtiments et des objets (des monnaies et des poteries) de cette époque. Des tombes voûtées ont également été identifiées sur la rive droite du Khosr à l'est de Kuyunjik.\nAprès la bataille de Gaugamèles remportée par le Macédonien Alexandre le Grand contre l'armée perse en 331 av. J.-C. et qui s'est probablement déroulée dans la plaine à proximité de Ninive, l'Assyrie passe sous domination grecque. Elle est ensuite contrôlée par les rois séleucides, puis devient l'objet de conflits entre plusieurs royaumes qui se succèdent sur son sol : vers 141 av. J.-C., le roi des Parthes Mithridate Ier vainc une première fois les Séleucides, et ses successeurs chassent les rois grecs définitivement de Mésopotamie, après d'autres conflits. La situation politique de la Haute Mésopotamie sous la période parthe est complexe. Vers 80 av. J.-C., le roi Tigrane II d'Arménie étend temporairement son royaume sur le Nord de la Mésopotamie, qui repasse ensuite sous domination parthe malgré les tentatives romaines. Elle voit aussi le développement du royaume d'Adiabène qui change plusieurs fois d'alliance dans les rivalités des grandes puissances. En 116, lors de l'invasion de la région par Trajan, Ninive est intégrée à l’éphémère province romaine d'Assyrie, qui disparaîtra en moins d'un an. Durant les décennies suivantes, la Haute Mésopotamie vit une période tourmentée, car elle est située dans la zone de lutte entre Romains et Parthes puis Sassanides.\nIl semble que Ninive devienne à un moment une cité grecque et une communauté de colons grecs s'y installe. Cette fondation remonte peut-être au règne de Séleucos Ier, fondateur de la dynastie des Séleucides, vers 300 av. J.-C., ou sous un de ses successeurs ; à moins qu'il ne faille retenir une date bien plus tardive, vers 80 av. J.-C., sous Tigrane II d'Arménie, souverain hellénisé. En réalité, nous sommes informés du fait que Ninive est une cité peuplée par une communauté grecque par des trouvailles provenant essentiellement de la période de la domination des Parthes. Des pièces de période séleucide et parthe ont en effet été trouvées dans la ville, qui a peut-être disposé d'un atelier de frappe de monnaies. Plusieurs inscriptions en grec ont été trouvées sur des objets exhumés à Ninive. Une colonne a été dédicacée à des dieux par un certain Apollophanes, stratège et épistate de la cité. L'œuvre d'art la plus remarquable de cette période est une statue de 50 cm de haut en calcaire représentant Héraclès Epitrapezios (identifié comme Hermès lors de sa découverte), réalisée par un certain Diogène au Ier siècle ou au IIe siècle de notre ère. Elle a été déposée dans un petit temple (de 3 mètres sur 4,4 mètres) dégagé dans la ville basse juste au nord de Nebi Yunus et dont le plan rappelle les anciens temples d'époque assyrienne. À proximité, on a retrouvé un ancien autel assyrien inscrit au nom de Sennacherib et réutilisé puis dédicacé par un magistrat local nommé Apollonios. Cette partie de la ville basse semble donc être importante durant les premiers siècles après Jésus-Christ. Cependant, ces traces d'hellénisation de la région ne remettent pas en question le fait que la région soit majoritairement peuplée d'Araméens, tandis que les Grecs perdent en importance au fil du temps.\n\nKuyunjik reste la partie principale de Ninive, sans doute celle où se trouvent les bâtiments publics les plus importants, notamment les temples. Des poteries, des restes de colonnes ou de statues de la période parthe y ont été exhumées. Deux trésors de monnaies contenant des pièces romaines et parthes du IIIe siècle apr. J.-C. ont été fouillés. Des tombes situées sur les ruines de l'ancien temple d'Ishtar ont livré un riche matériel, notamment des bijoux en or et pierres précieuses, datant probablement du début du IIe siècle après Jésus-Christ. Tout cela atteste de la prospérité de Ninive à cette période.\n\nPériodes sassanide et islamique : un important lieu de culte\nAprès la désastreuse campagne de l'empereur romain Julien face aux Perses Sassanides en 363 apr. J.-C., Ninive passe sous le contrôle de ces derniers qui y installent à leur tour une garnison frontalière. La culture matérielle de la ville acquiert alors des traits perses qui se retrouvent dans les quelques découvertes de cette période (monnaies, sceaux, objets en verre, etc.), provenant généralement de Kuyunjik, l'habitat semblant alors se resserrer autour de ce tell et de celui de Nebi Yunus. En 627, la plaine de Ninive est le théâtre d'une bataille entre les troupes byzantines et sassanides. C'est un peu plus de dix ans plus tard, en 637/8 ou en 641/2 que Ninive est prise par les troupes arabo-musulmanes.\n\nSur le plan religieux, Ninive est alors devenue une cité chrétienne importante (tout en hébergeant une communauté juive elle aussi de taille notable), puisque s'y trouvent les sièges d'évêchés nestorien et jacobite, ce dernier étant occupé au VIIe siècle par le théologien Isaac de Ninive qui n'y reste que cinq mois, ce qui n'empêche pas qu'on l'associe couramment à cette ville. Un monastère nestorien est construit sur Nebi Yunus, sans doute en lien avec la légende rapportant la venue du prophète Jonas à Ninive. Les souverains perses, bien que zoroastriens, tolèrent la religion chrétienne et restaurent parfois les monastères de la région. La même tolérance existe sous les premiers temps de la domination musulmane, mais une large partie de la population se convertit peu à peu à l'islam. Divers objets retrouvés à Kuyunjik attestent de la présence d'une communauté paléo-chrétienne dans la ville. Elle est notamment caractérisée par des poteries marquées d'une croix à branches de longueurs égales, motif qui se retrouve également sur une lampe en alliage à base de cuivre, et des plaques de stuc représentant des croix de différentes formes, qui sont des sortes d'icônes caractéristiques du christianisme de l'Irak des VIIe et VIIIe siècles.\nAprès la conquête arabe, Ninive décline face à sa voisine Mossoul, qui devient peu après la conquête une ville militaire (miṣr) et la capitale politique de la région, disposant d'une forte garnison, puis connaît une forte croissance. L'évêché nestorien de Ninive fut finalement fusionné à celui de Mossoul au IXe siècle. Cependant, une portion du site de l'antique capitale assyrienne garde une certaine importance : la colline de Nebi Yunus, qui passe pour porter le tombeau du prophète Jonas et qui a de ce fait le statut de lieu de pèlerinage, l'un des plus fréquentés de la Haute Mésopotamie. Une mosquée remplace l'ancien monastère chrétien. Elle est entourée au Xe siècle d'une hôtellerie visant à accueillir les pèlerins, à l'initiative de l'émir de Mossoul, Nasir al-Dawla des Hamdanides. Elle voisinait également un cimetière où sont enterrés des personnes recherchant la proximité du lieu saint. Une source thermale située à l'est du tell (ʿAyn Yūnus) est également visitée par des malades cherchant la guérison. Ce site apparaît dans les textes arabes des époques médiévale et moderne comme le Tall al-Tawba, la « Colline du repentir », en référence à la mission qu'aurait accomplie Jonas sur ce lieu. Quant au tell de Kuyunjik, il apparaît sous le nom de Kalʿat Nunia, la « Citadelle de Ninive », ou plus simplement al-Kalʿa, « la Citadelle », en référence aux ruines qui s'y trouvent. Son nom actuel est celui d'un village qui y est attesté au début du XIXe siècle, peuplé par des paysans de la minorité religieuse des Yézidis. Ils sont massacrés en 1836 au cours d'un des accès de violence religieuse qui agite alors la Haute Mésopotamie, et leur village est détruit, ce qui explique pourquoi les premiers fouilleurs purent explorer ce tell.\n\nNinive à son apogée\nAprès être devenue capitale de l'Assyrie sous Sennacherib, Ninive est l'une des principales villes du Moyen-Orient au VIIe siècle av. J.-C. Ce sont les niveaux archéologiques de cette période qui ont le plus attiré l'attention des différentes équipes de fouilleurs du site, ce qui justifie un développement plus long sur l'état de la ville à ce moment.\nNinive s'organise autour de deux tells séparés par la rivière Khosr : au sud, Nebi Yunus, et au nord, Kuyunjik. La première partie a été très peu explorée et semble avoir de toute manière été d'une moindre importance comparée à Kuyunjik. Hormis quelques temples, on y trouvait un ancien arsenal (ekal mašarti) restauré par Assarhaddon. L'espace urbain postérieur à l'œuvre de Sennacherib occupait une surface de 750 hectares entourés par une muraille de 12 km. Elle était alimentée en eau par divers canaux provenant des collines environnantes et les deux rivières bordant la cité.\nNinive était enfin un important centre cultuel. S'y trouvaient plusieurs temples. Tout d'abord, celui de la déesse principale de la ville, Ishtar de Ninive, et sa ziggurat, situés à Kuyunjik. La ville renfermait aussi d'importants temples dédiés à Nabû, Assur, Adad, etc.\nÉtant la dernière capitale voulue et construite par un monarque de l'empire assyrien, après les chantiers de Kalkhu sous Assurnasirpal II (883-859 av. J.-C.) puis Dur-Sharrukin sous Sargon II (722-705 av. J.-C.), le propre père de Sennacherib, Ninive est l'apogée de la tradition architecturale et urbanistique de cette civilisation. Cette métropole est un concentré des capacités des aménageurs assyriens : les travaux entrepris sous Sennacherib et ses successeurs attestent de leurs connaissances dans les aménagements hydrauliques alors que les ouvrages défensifs, les jardins, l'urbanisme, les constructions publiques et les palais royaux du tell de Kuyunjik témoignent d'un savoir-faire remarquable.\n\nAménagements hydrauliques\nBien que naturellement alimentée par le Khosr et proche du Tigre ainsi que de diverses sources naturelles, Ninive n'est pas suffisamment bien alimentée en eau pour pouvoir devenir la grande capitale que souhaite Sennacherib. Ce dernier cherchait surtout à arroser les jardins qu'il crée et à étendre la surface agricole servant à nourrir la cité. Le projet est donc d'ampleur régionale et il implique la rénovation des canaux existant, la création de nouveaux, ainsi que la construction de plusieurs barrages et d'autres ouvrages hydrauliques comme un aqueduc. Sennacherib prétendit avoir fait aménager tous les points d'eau connus des alentours de Ninive. Cependant, ce dispositif ne suffit pas puisqu'il fallait aller capter l'eau de divers cours d'eau dans les régions hautes situées au nord de la ville.\nCertains de ces aménagements ont été fouillés ou repérés sur le terrain et plus récemment par l'utilisation de photographies aériennes et d'images satellites. Ces ouvrages ont aussi fait l'objet d'inscriptions de Sennacherib, accompagnées de bas-reliefs à Khinis et Maltai au nord de Ninive à proximité de certains ouvrages. Si ce roi se situe dans la continuité de ses prédécesseurs, qui ont également fait réaliser des aménagements hydrauliques importants autour des anciennes capitales assyriennes, une nouvelle fois il pousse la démarche à un niveau supérieur, ce qui impliquait la mobilisation de moyens considérables. Comme l'eau était captée dans une région au relief tourmenté, il fallait parfois creuser la roche et dégager de grands espaces. Ces aménagements supposaient des ingénieurs connaissant bien la topographie et le climat de la région, ainsi que le régime de ses cours d'eau. Finalement, ils ont modifié le réseau hydrologique de la région de Ninive et son paysage. Cela demandait une administration lourde et un entretien constant, et, quand l'empire assyrien s'est effondré, le système n'a pas duré, même si certains aménagements ont pu être restaurés localement pendant de longues périodes.\n\nPlusieurs étapes peuvent être distinguées dans le programme de construction d'un réseau de canaux lors de l'extension de Ninive, qui dura principalement une quinzaine d'années, de 702 à 688 av. J.-C. La première phase vit la réalisation du canal de Kisiri qui reliait alors le nord de la ville et rejoignait le Khosr 13 kilomètres en amont, au niveau du barrage de Shallahat, proche de Dur-Sharrukin. Un barrage est construit sur le Khosr à Ajileh, juste en amont de Ninive. Les aménagements les plus importants sont réalisés plus au nord : un système de cours d'eau canalisés et de canaux creusés long d'environ 100 kilomètres servait à dériver les eaux de cours d'eau situés dans des régions de collines au nord-est, dont celles d'affluents du Grand Zab (qui se jette dans le Tigre en aval du Khosr). Sur son tracé, on a retrouvé un important aqueduc, à Jerwan, permettant au canal de franchir une vallée où coule un wadi. Il fait 280 mètres de long pour 22 mètres de large, et sa construction a demandé environ 2 millions de blocs de pierre. Le wadi et probablement une piste passaient sous l'aqueduc en son centre dans des passages voûtés. Le canal situé en amont de Jerwan est celui de Khinis, qui capte les eaux de l'actuel Gomel sur plus de 50 kilomètres. C'est sans doute le dernier à avoir été réalisé, et le plus long. Un autre système de canaux véhicule de l'eau provenant de plus au nord-ouest, vers Maltai.\n\n« Sur une longue distance, depuis le fleuve Husur (le Khosr), je fis creuser un canal vers les prairies de Ninive ; par-dessus des wadis profonds je fis passer un pont de pierres blanches et je fis couler ces eaux dessus. »\n\n— Inscription de Sennacherib sur l'aqueduc de Jerwan.\nLes canaux sont de tailles diverses selon la quantité d'eau qu'ils devaient capter et transporter : celui de Khinis, en amont du barrage de Jerwan, faisait environ 6 mètres de large pour 2 mètres de profondeur car il captait encore peu de cours d'eau ; il s'élargit ensuite autour d'une vingtaine de mètres pour capter l'eau de nouvelles rivières. Par endroits, des canaux creusés avaient nécessité le dégagement d'un espace de près de 70-100 mètres de large (qui ne correspond pas forcément à la largeur du canal).\n\nLes remparts et les portes\nLes murailles de la ville au temps de Sennacherib étaient un ouvrage impressionnant, qui a frappé l'imagination dès l'Antiquité : Diodore de Sicile lui attribue une longueur de 27 kilomètres. En réalité, la muraille était constituée de deux enceintes (une intérieure et une extérieure) qui encerclaient la ville sur une longueur d'environ 12 km, suivant un tracé de forme trapézoïdale. Les longs côtés étaient constitués par la partie est de la muraille qui courait sur environ 5 kilomètres et la partie ouest qui mesurait 4,1 kilomètres de long, tandis que les petits côtés mesuraient 2 kilomètres au nord, et 800 mètres au sud. Les murs étaient faits avec de grands blocs calcaires provenant de carrières situées 50 km en amont le long du Tigre, renforcés par des briques crues en argile. Le système défensif était très puissant, et, à certains endroits, son épaisseur approchait les 45 mètres, tandis que, selon les dires de Sennacherib, sa hauteur était de 25 mètres. Le nom antique des deux enceintes était évocateur quant à leurs fonctions : « mur dont l'éclat submerge l'ennemi » (en sumérien BÀD NÍ.GAL.BI KÚR.RA ŠÚ.ŠÚ) pour l'enceinte intérieure ; « mur qui terrifie le Mal » (BÀD NÍG.ERÍM HU.LUH.HA) pour l'enceinte extérieure. Des fossés d'environ 55 mètres de large avaient été creusés en avant des murailles et devaient donc être franchis par des ponts, dont deux ont pu être repérés en face des portes de Shamash et de Halzi. Les deux tells principaux étaient également protégés par une enceinte.\nDix-huit portes perçaient la muraille extérieure selon les textes de fondation les plus récents de Sennacherib, mais seulement une douzaine ont été localisées avec certitude. Au sud, la porte d'Assur accueillait les voyageurs ayant remonté le long du Tigre, depuis la direction de la ville du même nom. À l'ouest, la muraille comptait au moins cinq portes, et à l'est, six. Au nord, il y avait trois portes, portant respectivement les noms des dieux Adad, Nergal et Sîn, auxquelles elles étaient dédiées. Chacune de ces portes avait sa particularité, signe que les Ninivites portaient grande attention à ces édifices, censés frapper le visiteur à l'instant même où il pénètre dans la cité. Elles étaient de plus flanquées de tours défensives. La localisation de trois portes connues par les textes est discutée, le plus probable étant qu'elles soient situées sur la muraille ouest : celle de Handuri, celle du Quai et celle du Désert.\nPlusieurs portes ont fait l'objet de fouilles, plus ou moins précises et certaines ont été partiellement restaurées par le Département des Antiquités irakiennes. La porte de Halzi, située au sud de la ville, est l'une des plus imposantes portes de Ninive et la mieux connue par les archéologues. De forme rectangulaire, elle occupe environ 70 mètres dans la muraille orientale. L'entrée (de 7 mètres de large à l'origine) se trouvait dans un angle, et l'accès depuis l'extérieur s'y faisait par un pont. L'édifice s'organise autour d'une cour centrale de 45 mètres sur 19 mètres, où ont été dégagés 22 orthostates disposés sur le mur ouest. Huit tours de qualité différente protégeaient la porte, les moins solides ayant probablement été construites devant l'imminence du siège de la ville entre 614 et 612 av. J.-C., période qui vit également l'entrée être réduite à 2 mètres de large.\nLa porte de Mashki a été ciblée lors des destructions perpétrées par Daesh à Ninive en 2016. Par la suite des restaurations et fouilles y ont été entreprises, qui ont mis au jour en 2022 des fragments de bas-reliefs semblables à ceux qui ornaient les palais royaux.\n\nLa ville basse\nD'abord relatée dans la description qu'en donne Sennacherib, dans les textes relatant les aménagements qu'il fit faire à Ninive, la ville basse est un peu mieux connue à la suite de prospections menées dans sa partie nord à la fin des années 1980, limitées toutefois par la progression de l'urbanisation sur le site. La ville basse de Ninive est coupée en deux par le cours du Khosr. Ce dernier et les autres cours d'eau et fossés de la ville étaient franchissables par plusieurs ponts, les emplacements de certains ayant pu être repérés. Plusieurs grandes avenues, dont certaines étaient pavées, reliaient les portes principales. La plus importante était la « Voie royale », qui aurait mesuré environ 28,50 mètres ou plus de large et était délimitée par des stèles sur ses côtés.\n\n« En ce temps-là, j'agrandis le site de Ninive, ma cité royale. J'élargis ses rues afin qu'elles conviennent à une \"voie royale\" et les fis briller comme le jour. Afin qu'à l'avenir la voie royale ne puisse pas devenir plus étroite, je la fis border de stèles qui se faisaient face. Je donnais à cette voie une largeur de 62 grandes coudées, jusqu'à la porte du Parc. Si jamais un habitant de cette ville détruit sa vieille maison pour en bâtir une autre et fait empiéter les fondations de sa maison sur la voie royale, on l'empalera sur un pieu planté sur sa maison. »\n\n— Inscription de Sennacherib sur la « Voie royale ».\nS. Lumsden a proposé d'identifier les fonctions de différentes parties de la ville : au nord de Kuyunjik, et dans la partie située entre ce tell et Nebi Yunus, on aurait trouvé les résidences des élites, tandis que la partie située au sud de Nebi Yunus aurait eu une fonction surtout militaire. La partie orientale de la moitié nord aurait été occupée par une « Terrasse orientale », où se trouvaient peut-être des jardins internes à la ville, en sachant qu'il y en avait aussi à l'extérieur à proximité des murailles, probablement le long du cours du Tigre, à l'ouest.\nAvant que Sennacherib n'étende le périmètre de Ninive, la ville basse occupait un espace au nord du tell de Kuyunjik nommé la « Vieille ville ». Les prospections y ont identifié pour le VIIe siècle av. J.-C. un ensemble de résidences luxueuses organisées autour de cours centrales vastes, avec de larges rues délimitant les îlots d'habitation. Il s'agit donc manifestement d'un quartier d'élites, situé à proximité du centre du pouvoir. Au nord de celui-ci, et jusqu'aux murailles, un quartier d'artisanat à l'habitat plus tassé a été repéré. Des ateliers de potiers et de métallurgistes ont été repérés. Ces deux quartiers étaient bordés à l'est par une large voie reliant la porte de Nergal à Kuyunjik, peut-être la « Voie royale ». La partie nord-est du site est moins bien connue. Elle comprenait elle aussi des ateliers de céramique.\nAu sud du Khosr, plusieurs édifices ont été repérés. Un premier a été identifié comme étant un bīt hilāni (type de bâtiment d'origine syrienne caractérisé par un portique à colonnes servant d'entrée), en raison des bases de piliers repérées, ce qui est en fait insuffisant pour le définir comme un édifice de ce type. À proximité, un bâtiment de type palatial a été exploré, organisé autour d'au moins une grande cour, qui a livré deux tablettes cunéiformes. Des abreuvoirs à chevaux portant des inscriptions au nom de Sennacherib ont également été mis au jour près des murailles juste au nord de Nebi Yunus.\nLa partie est de Ninive, au nord du Khosr, a vu la réalisation d'un aménagement original lors des travaux entrepris par Sennacherib : la « Terrasse orientale ». Surélevée par rapport au reste de la cité basse, S. Lumsden en a proposé une fonction spécifique dans le projet de Sennacherib qui concernait aussi la vie des habitants de la capitale. Selon lui, elle procurait un espace d'où admirer un panorama de la métropole au temps de son apogée. En effet, elle était probablement ouverte au public, car elle n'était pas fortifiée à la différence des citadelles de Kuyunjik et Nebi Yunus. C'est peut-être un des endroits où se trouvaient des vergers et jardins à l'intérieur de la ville, évoqués dans les récits sur la construction de Ninive. D'autres propositions sont possibles telles : fonction cérémonielle, espace commercial ou récréatif, etc.\n\nLes jardins de Ninive\nDes jardins avaient été aménagés en divers points de la cité, à l'intérieur des murs, mais aussi à l'extérieur le long des deux cours d'eau alimentant la ville et des canaux. Leur repérage sur le terrain est plus problématique et leur localisation est pour l'instant de l'ordre de l'hypothèse. Ils ont eu une fonction cruciale dans l'idéologie du pouvoir des rois qui les ont fait construire. S'y trouvait une grande quantité d'essences d'arbres, surtout des arbres fruitiers, de la vigne, le relief et l'espace étant parfois modifiés pour imiter les régions montagneuses ou marécageuses. Ainsi, les rois reproduisaient en miniature les régions qu'ils avaient conquises, et introduisaient dans leurs jardins des plantes inconnues en Assyrie, comme le cotonnier, appelé « arbre à laine ». Pour leur agrément, ils construisaient des petits édifices, où ils pouvaient donner des banquets. Des animaux exotiques venant des pays conquis étaient également introduits pour le bon plaisir des rois et surtout montrer l'ampleur de leur pouvoir, car ils symbolisaient la domination exercée par les souverains sur les pays d'où ils venaient, et leur capacité à recréer un espace fertile plein de vie dans un lieu auparavant désertique. Il s'agissait donc non seulement de jardins, mais aussi de sortes de zoos, de véritables parcs, solidaires de la conception du pouvoir et du monde de la royauté assyrienne.\n\n« Pour contrôler le flot de ces eaux (du fleuve et des canaux), je fis un marais et y plantai une cannaie. J'y laissai en liberté des hérons, des sangliers et des cerfs. Par la volonté divine, dans les jardins au sol fraîchement labouré, poussèrent en abondance de la vigne, toutes sortes d’arbres fruitiers, des oliviers et des arbres aromatiques. Des cyprès, des mûriers (?), ainsi que toutes sortes d'arbres, y poussèrent en grande taille et eurent des rejets. Les marais se développèrent rapidement. Les oiseaux du ciel, les hérons dont la région d'origine est lointaine, y firent leurs nids. Les sangliers et les cerfs y donnèrent naissance à une multitude de petits. Je coupai les cyprès et les mûriers qui avaient grandi dans les jardins, ainsi que les roseaux des marais et je les utilisai pour la construction de mes palais royaux. On récolta du coton (« on tondit les arbres porteurs de laine ») et on en tissa pour faire des vêtements. »\n\n— L'aménagement des parcs royaux de Ninive, d'après une inscription de Sennacherib.\nSuivant les descriptions des bas-reliefs des palais et des textes, les jardins étaient alimentés par des aqueducs, et peut-être même par des conduites amenant l'eau sur des terrasses surélevées. Si on accepte l'existence de tels jardins surélevés, on peut suivre la proposition de Stephanie Dalley (en) selon laquelle il faudrait chercher à Ninive l'origine des « jardins suspendus de Babylone », qui ne se trouveraient en réalité pas dans cette dernière cité (où ils ne sont attestés ni dans les textes ni par l'archéologie), mais plutôt à Ninive, où les indices seraient un peu plus consistants (mais pas déterminants). La proposition de Dalley a fait l'objet de diverses critiques. L'existence de « jardins suspendus » n'est en réalité pas plus certaine en Assyrie qu'en Babylonie, vu qu'ils ne sont pas explicitement évoqués dans les textes ni repérés sur place, mais peut-être représentés sur un bas-relief, qui peut s'interpréter autrement. Il est impossible de savoir en quoi auraient consisté exactement ces éventuels jardins surélevés, quelle apparence ils auraient prise, quels mécanismes auraient été en jeu.\n\nNebi Yunus, l'arsenal de Ninive\nSur une surface de 14 hectares, situé à environ 1 kilomètre au sud de Kuyunjik, le tell de Nebi Yunus (« Prophète Jonas ») est, comme son nom l'indique, le lieu où la tradition veut que le prophète Jonas ait été enterré. Ce dernier aurait en effet été envoyé à Ninive par Dieu, ce que relate le Livre de Jonas, qui sert de source sur l'histoire de Ninive et de sa chute, et a beaucoup compté dans la préservation de la mémoire de la cité après sa destruction. Ce tell est donc un lieu saint, qui attire des pèlerins, et est surmonté d'une mosquée, en plus d'un village. Cela a donc empêché d'y faire des fouilles de grande dimension, même si quelques campagnes ont pu être effectuées au bord du tell par des équipes irakiennes.\nEn l'absence de fouilles importantes sur place, il est impossible de savoir quand commence le peuplement de ce tell. Les connaissances des archéologues reposent essentiellement sur des trouvailles épigraphiques effectuées sur le tell et ailleurs, notamment des inscriptions de fondation laissées par les rois assyriens ayant entrepris des constructions sur le site, avant tout Sennacherib et son fils Assarhaddon. La plus ancienne attestation de construction sur le site remonterait au règne d'Adad-nerari III (882-859 av. J.-C.), mais c'est à partir du règne de Sennacherib que l'on dispose de connaissances correctes sur le tell, qui entre dans son programme de travaux à Ninive.\nLes textes des rois assyriens nous apprennent qu'ils avaient bâti sur ce tell un arsenal, appelé ekal kutalli (« palais arrière » ou « palais de la réserve (militaire) ») ou ekal mašarti (« palais de la revue (militaire) »). Sennacherib dit avoir détruit un bâtiment plus ancien dont on ignore la nature exacte, pour construire cet édifice. Si on se base sur les fouilles effectuées dans l'arsenal de Kalkhu et la description qu'en donnent les textes de Sennacherib, ce bâtiment dispose de bâtiments résidentiels s'apparentant à un palais royal à côté desquels se trouve l'arsenal à proprement parler. Il sert de quartier général aux armées assyriennes. Nebi Yunus avait donc une fonction militaire, comportant des magasins, des ateliers de fabrications d'armes, des étables pour chevaux. C'est également là que l'on entreposait une partie du butin de guerre rapporté par l'armée d'Assyrie. Sennacherib dit avoir bâti deux ensembles de bâtiments résidentiels, probablement avec une salle du trône et des appartements, l'un dans un style « assyrien », l'autre dans un style « du Hatti », en fait de Syrie, donc probablement une construction de type bīt-hilani. Assarhaddon entreprend à son tour un programme de constructions autour de l'arsenal, qui est considérablement agrandi. Une de ses inscriptions indique la fonction de l'édifice : « maintenir le campement (et) garder les chevaux, les mulets, les chars, l'équipement militaire, les instruments de guerre, et le butin fait sur l'ennemi ». Il s'attache surtout à faire de la partie résidentielle un palais royal plus vaste. C'est la construction la plus importante entreprise par ce souverain à Ninive et c'est peut-être là qu'il réside une partie de l'année. Son fils Assurbanipal effectue également des travaux dans l'arsenal.\nLes fouilleurs irakiens ont retrouvé sur Nebi Yunus divers objets en 1954, dont quelques tablettes, un prisme inscrit d'Assarhaddon, et des pièces de butin rapportées par les rois assyriens à la suite de campagnes victorieuses, notamment trois statues du pharaon Taharqa et une statuette en bronze de la déesse égyptienne Anoukis. Ils ont également dégagé au nord-est du tell une porte monumentale menant à l'arsenal, dont les montants sont gardés par des taureaux androcéphales comme il est habituel dans les palais assyriens. Lors de travaux de restauration dans le sanctuaire de Jonas, au milieu des années 1970, les ouvriers ont mis au jour un fragment de bas-relief sur orthostates, représentant des personnages conduisant des chevaux. Par la suite lors de l'occupation du site par l'État islamique, après la destruction du mausolée de Jonas, les Djihadistes ont creusé des galeries dans le tell (apparemment pour prendre des objets d'art et les revendre) et mis au jour des éléments du palais d'Assarhaddon qui ont pu être explorés après la reprise du site par les troupes irakiennes, notamment fragments de bas-reliefs, et des inscriptions murales.\n\nKuyunjik, le cœur de l'empire assyrien\nLe cœur de Ninive est le tell de Kuyunjik, qui tient son nom d'un village établi sur son bord nord-est avant les premières fouilles, qui signifierait en turc « petit mouton ». C'est la partie la plus anciennement peuplée, depuis le VIIe millénaire av. J.-C., celle autour de laquelle elle s'est développée et qui a fait de loin l'objet du plus de campagnes de fouilles car elle était quasi déserte quand les archéologues ont investi le site. Il s'étend sur plus de 40 hectares, mesurant sur sa longueur maximale environ 1 kilomètre et 600 mètres sur sa largeur maximale et surplombe aujourd'hui la plaine environnante de plus de 30 mètres. Après les travaux de Sennacherib, c'est le centre de l'empire assyrien, où se trouvent les palais royaux principaux, la famille royale, la cour, et les archives royales. Ce tell conserve sa fonction traditionnelle d'espace sacré, car on y trouve le temple de la divinité tutélaire de la ville, Ishtar de Ninive, qui a une fonction importante dans l'empire assyrien, avec sa ziggourat qui dominait toute la ville, ainsi que le temple du dieu Nabû.\n\nLes temples\nLe centre du tell de Kuyunjik est occupé par un groupe de temples, dont l'établissement doit remonter aux périodes les plus anciennes du site. Le temple d'Ishtar de Ninive, déesse tutélaire de la cité aussi connue sous les noms de Shaushga, Inanna, Ninlil/Mullissu, déesses de diverses origines unies par syncrétisme, ou encore sous l'épithète « Dame de Ninive », est le principal lieu de culte de la cité. Il est connu sous le nom sumérien É.MÈŠ.MÈŠ ou É.MAŠ.MAŠ, mais apparaît aussi sous le nom de É.GAL (« grande maison/temple » en sumérien), qui généralement désigne un palais, ou encore bīt nathi (« maison/temple du lit », le second terme étant d'origine hourrite), qui semble désigner plus spécifiquement les appartements de la déesse dans le temple, où avaient lieu les rituels majeurs. Lors de ses fouilles qui n'ont dégagé qu'une partie de l'édifice, une trentaine de phases ont été distinguées, s'étendant au moins du IVe millénaire au VIe siècle av. J.-C. Les datations et parfois même la pertinence de toutes ces phases font l'objet de discussion, notamment en raison de relevés de fouilles imprécis. C'est un édifice particulièrement important pour la connaissance du site, grâce aux nombreuses trouvailles d'objets et d'inscriptions qui y ont été effectuées, car il s'agissait du cœur historique de Kuyunjik, qui a fait l'objet de nombreuses attentions de la part des souverains dominant la Haute Mésopotamie au moins à partir du début du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. Si l'on se fie à l'inscription laissée par Samsi-Addu lors de sa reconstruction au XVIIIe siècle av. J.-C., Manishtusu d'Akkad l'aurait (re)bâti au XXIIIe siècle av. J.-C., mais cela n'est pas vérifiable. Il est en tout cas constamment rénové par les souverains assyriens jusqu'à la chute du site. Pour l'époque néo-assyrienne, le premier chantier de rénovation important date du temps d'Assurnasirpal II au IXe siècle av. J.-C. puisque des clous de fondation, des dalles sculptées et des briques émaillées ont été retrouvés. Sennacherib le place dans la liste des monuments de la ville qu'il a restaurés, mais les traces de ses travaux sur place sont maigres. Assurbanipal est le dernier à organiser la décoration de l'édifice et de sa ziggurat.\nLocalisé au centre même du tell, ce temple est mal connu en raison de ses fouilles incomplètes. Les reconstitutions proposées par J. Reade semblent indiquer que son plan n'a pas subi de grands changements depuis le temps de Samsi-Addu. Il est de forme rectangulaire et d'orientation sud-ouest/nord-est, mesure environ 55 mètres de large pour au moins 106 mètres de long. L'entrée semble s'effectuer par le côté sud-ouest, qui mène à l'époque néo-assyrienne à une première cour menant à une seconde plus vaste qui occupe le centre de l'édifice. La cella abritant la statue de la déesse et son trône se trouvait manifestement dans la continuité vers le nord-est, mais elle n'a pas été dégagée. Le temple était associé à une ziggurat dédiée elle aussi à Ishtar, dont il ne reste plus rien et qui n'est donc connue que par des inscriptions royales et une prière néo-assyrienne à la déesse. Samsi-Addu lui attribue à elle aussi une première construction sous Manishtusu. Il se charge de l'agrandir, et plus tard elle est restaurée par Salmanazar Ier puis par les rois Sargonides. Elle était peut-être située juste au sud-ouest du temple, en face de l'entrée principale de celui-ci et également du palais sud-ouest, au point le plus élevé de Kuyunjik et donc de toute la ville. Un dernier édifice associé au culte d'Ishtar de Ninive était son bīt akītu connu uniquement par des inscriptions des rois néo-assyriens (mais peut-être existant dès l'époque médio-assyrienne) y ayant entrepris des travaux. Sa localisation sur Kuyunjik ; il est peut-être à chercher vers le nord ou l'ouest du grand temple. Il s'agit d'un type d'édifice cultuel courant dans les grandes villes babyloniennes et adopté en Assyrie, servant lors de la grande fête nommée akītu qui avait généralement lieu lors du Nouvel An, durant laquelle une grande procession reliait le temple principal d'Ishtar au bīt akītu, la statue de la déesse faisant le trajet sur son chariot processionnel. Un autre bīt akītu semble avoir été bâti par Sennacherib, mais hors des murs de Ninive, comme cela était courant pour ce type de bâtiment.\nC'est dans le temple qu'a notamment été découverte la tête en bronze d'un souverain de la dynastie d'Akkad (peut-être Naram-Sîn), qui est considérée comme l'une des plus belles œuvres d'art de la Mésopotamie antique. De nombreuses autres trouvailles d'objets de culte ou de tablettes ont également été réalisées dans le secteur du temple d'Ishtar.\nPlusieurs autres temples du tell de Kuyunjik sont connus uniquement par des textes, dédiés à Assur, Kidmuri (un aspect d'Ishtar) et aux Sibitti. Un seul autre a été dégagé au cours de fouilles, à savoir le temple d'époque néo-assyrienne dédié à Nabû, situé au nord du temple d'Ishtar. Il était nommé É.ZI.DA (« Temple juste »), comme d'autres temples de ce même dieu connus à Kalkhu et Borsippa. Sa construction semble attribuable à Adad-nerari III vers 788-787 av. J.-C., fervent dévot du dieu, et il a fait l'objet de rénovations sous Assurbanipal. La partie qui en a été dégagée constitue un ensemble de forme trapézoïdale, bâti sur une terrasse, et s'organisant autour d'une cour centrale de 35 mètres sur 26 mètres. Le temple s'étendait peut-être plus loin sur le côté sud-ouest, dans un espace non fouillé. Une bibliothèque (girginakku) y était conservée, Nabû étant le dieu de la sagesse. Les autres temples connus par les textes étaient dédiés à Ishtar de Kidmuri (une ville assyrienne), au dieu national assyrien Assur, aux Sibitti, groupe de sept divinités guerrières, aux divinités astrales : Sîn (le dieu-lune) et Shamash (le dieu-soleil), associés dans le même lieu de culte comme c'est le cas à Assur, et également au dieu de l'orage Adad, disposant d'une ziggurat, ce qui fait que deux édifices de ce type se trouvaient sur l'acropole de Ninive.\n\nLes palais royaux\nNinive a servi de résidence royale temporaire à plusieurs reprises avant le règne de Sennacherib, et possédait donc un palais sur le tell de Kuyundjik au moins à partir du IXe siècle av. J.-C. Les fouilles de Campbell Thompson et Hutchinson ont ainsi dégagé les ruines d'un édifice palatial ayant livré plusieurs inscriptions d'Assurnasirpal II (883-859) qui y a sans doute résidé au début de son règne. Ils y ont retrouvé des fragments de décoration murale : peintures représentant des rosettes et des personnages, certaines étant des scènes militaires peintes sur des orthostates qui sont donc des précurseurs des bas-reliefs ultérieurs.\nLes différents palais royaux de Kuyunjik datés de la période finale de l'empire assyrien (VIIe siècle av. J.-C.), servant de centre de l'empire à partir du règne de Sennacherib, sont l'aboutissement d'une longue tradition de constructions de ce type d'édifices entamée dès le IXe siècle av. J.-C. par Assurnasirpal II à Kalkhu, et poursuivie par ses successeurs sur le même site puis à Dur-Sharrukin. Il s'agit du type de monument le plus impressionnant et représentatif de la civilisation assyrienne, qui n'a pas d'équivalent dans le reste du Proche-Orient ancien avant les palais perses achéménides, qui ont largement repris la tradition assyrienne.\n\n« Je conférai ainsi à tout ce palais la perfection qu'il convenait ; de son ensemble j'élevai le faîte afin de provoquer l'admiration de tous les peuples et lui donnai pour nom celui de \"Palais sans rival\" »\n\n— Inscription de Sennacherib.\nCette longue expérience assyrienne culmine dans l'édifice qui s'élève au sud-ouest de Kuyunjik, le « Palais sans rival » (ÉGALZAGDINUTUKUA en sumérien, employé pour les noms cérémoniels) de Sennacherib, appelé aussi « Nouveau palais » (bītu eššu) dans les textes antiques, et dénommé « Palais sud-ouest » par Layard lors des fouilles. C'est un ouvrage massif érigé au rebord du tell, surplombant le cours du Khosr. Il était bâti sur des fondations d'une profondeur d'une vingtaine de mètres, et mesurait à l'aboutissement des travaux (qui se sont étalés entre 700 et 691) environ 500 mètres de long sur 200 mètres de large, selon les chiffres donnés par Sennacherib, problématiques puisqu'ils varient selon les versions de ses récits de construction (les plus tardifs prenant manifestement en compte des travaux d'extension). Ces données sont invérifiables dans la mesure où tout l'édifice n'a pas été dégagé par les archéologues (qui ont œuvré sur environ 200 m2), dont les techniques de fouilles, orientées vers la découverte de sculptures et objets, n'étaient du reste pas propres à assurer une bonne préservation et une bonne connaissance de l'organisation de l'édifice. La partie dégagée est organisée autour d'une vaste cour intérieure (cour XIX, 38,5 × 42,5 mètres) desservant des unités constituées de cours secondaires et de salles parallèles (peut-être des suites de réception) qui étaient décorées par des séries de bas-reliefs. Elle devait correspondre au secteur public (babānu) attesté dans les autres palais néo-assyriens. Une salle allongée (B dans la classification de Layard, I dans celle de Campbell-Thomson, approximativement 51 × 12,25 mètres), située dans la partie nord-est de la zone fouillée semble correspondre à la salle du trône, précédée par une autre salle allongée (G/V) qui ouvrait sur une grande cour de la partie publique, non dégagée. Au nord-ouest de la zone fouillée se trouvait un autre groupe de suites, autour d'une cour (LXIV) que des inscriptions semblent rattacher à Tashmetu-sharrat, épouse de Sennacherib. Vers l'est devaient se trouver les appartements royaux, dans un vaste espace non fouillé. L'édifice rejoignait peut-être un autre édifice fouillé environ 300 mètres plus au nord-est sur le bord du tell, le « palais oriental » ou bīt nakkapti. Le tout devait constituer un vaste ensemble s'étirant sur environ 500 mètres sur le rebord du tell comme l'indiquent les inscriptions royales, comprenant probablement plus de 200 salles et organisé autour de plusieurs grandes cours (une dans la zone fouillée, une ou deux dans celle qui ne l'a pas été), la partie non fouillée devant être moins large que celle qui l'a été (large de presque 200 mètres), ce qui correspondrait aux données des textes de Sennacherib.\nAssurbanipal résida au début de son règne dans le palais de son grand-père, dont il fit restaurer certaines ailes, puis il s'est doté de son propre palais au nord-est de Kuyunjik, à l'angle opposé du palais sud-ouest, en réaménageant une ancienne construction précédant les rénovations de son grand-père Sennacherib, le bīt redutī (« Palais nord » selon la terminologie actuelle), édifice destiné à l'origine au successeur désigné au trône d'Assyrie et à son administration et déjà restauré par le refondateur de Ninive. Le plan de cet édifice est encore moins bien connu que celui du palais sud-ouest, notamment en raison de la forte érosion de cette partie du site. Il occupait au moins un espace au sol de 250 mètres de long sur 150 mètres de large. L'accès devait se faire par son côté est. Seules les pièces centrales ont été dégagées, comprenant une partie des salles d'audience, notamment la salle du trône (la salle M), située apparemment dans un groupe de quelques pièces à la jonction entre deux grandes cours intérieures.\n\nLe décor des palais\nDe nombreuses salles des deux palais étaient décorées de grandes dalles de pierre sculptées, les orthostates, qui font partie des plus belles jamais réalisées par les Assyriens, dont beaucoup se trouvent de nos jours au British Museum et dont le succès ne s'est jamais démenti comme l'illustrent les nombreuses publications dont elles font l'objet. Selon les calculs de Layard, c'étaient en tout plus de 3 km de frises qui ornaient le seul palais de Sennacherib. Cette ampleur dépasse largement les précédents palais royaux, où seules quelques pièces étaient décorées de la sorte ; ici il s'agit de près de 70 pièces ornées de la sorte. Ces bas-reliefs commémoraient des hauts faits des règnes des souverains, surtout des campagnes victorieuses (35 des 38 groupes de reliefs identifiés), mais aussi la construction du palais lui-même. Des inscriptions les accompagnent, notamment des textes courts, les « épigraphes », qui les commentent et permettent de suivre l'histoire racontée par les reliefs, comme une sorte de bande dessinée.\nLorsqu'il explora le palais de Sennacherib, Layard fit sensation en exhumant dans la salle XXXVI des reliefs relatant le siège de Lakish entrepris par ce roi, événement dont on trouve un écho dans l'Ancien Testament.\n\nDans la cour VI, les bas-reliefs décrivent le processus de réalisation et de transport des fameux taureaux ailés qui gardent le palais : on effectue une première ébauche de la statue aux carrières de Balaṭai, puis on la transporte sur des rondins de bois tirés par des hommes, le tout sous le regard de Sennacherib lui-même, assis sur son trône ; la scène se répète sur plusieurs paysages (des marais, le bord d'une rivière), puis la série se termine par l'arrivée au palais (où des finitions sont sans doute effectuées). Cette représentation de scènes de construction et l'attention dans la représentation des paysages des scènes sculptées sont des innovations des artistes du règne de Sennacherib.\n\nQuant à Assurbanipal, il fit réaliser dans la salle XXXIII du palais de son grand-père une série de bas-reliefs racontant sa victoire sur l'Élam et son roi Te-Umman près de la rivière Ulaï, puis l'intronisation d'un nouveau souverain à sa botte dans ce royaume, Ummanigash. En revanche les derniers affrontements de son règne contre l'Élam, qui se soldent par la prise de Suse, furent représentés sur les murs du palais nord. Des tablettes mises au jour à Ninive contiennent des textes courts, des épigraphes qui renvoient à des bas-reliefs retrouvés, notamment ceux relatifs à cette campagne élamite ; peut-être s'agissait-il de textes fournis aux lapicides afin de les graver sur les bas-reliefs. En tout cas leur lien avec les bas-reliefs semble évident en raison de correspondances, et ils permettent de reconstituer les scènes manquantes. Ils indiquent aussi que l'ensemble suivait un déroulement narratif grossièrement similaire à celui des annales du souverain consacré à la campagne élamite, mais en divergeait par endroits.\n\nUne autre série de bas-reliefs du palais sud-ouest réalisée sous Assurbanipal pour décorer la salle XXVIII relate une campagne dans les régions marécageuses du sud de la Babylonie.\n\nDans son nouveau palais, le palais nord, Assurbanipal fit réaliser d'autres bas-reliefs, les plus caractéristiques étant ceux le montrant en train de chasser des lions et d'autres animaux sauvages, notamment des gazelles, des équidés, des lièvres, des oiseaux (surtout dans les salles C et S du palais). La série de bas-reliefs de la salle C, un long couloir, a été retrouvée dans un état de conservation remarquable. Un premier groupe d'orthostates réparti sur les murs au nord-est et au sud-est de la salle montre le déroulement d'une première chasse aux lions : des serviteurs préparent les armes et le char du roi, puis la scène se déplace sur une colline où se trouve un pavillon de chasse ; les lions sont apportés sur place dans des cages, puis relâchés, et le roi les combat depuis son char, entouré de ses gardes, et devant quelques spectateurs situés en retrait. Une autre composition occupait le mur sud-ouest de la salle, et est notamment remarquable par la description de l'agonie des félins, notamment une lionne criblée de flèches. Ces sculptures se caractérisent par les nombreux vides laissés dans la composition, ce qui est inhabituel de la part des artistes des palais assyriens. Elles mettent en avant la mise à mort des animaux par le souverain, vainqueur des forces de la nature sauvage et notamment de leur plus redoutable représentant.\n\nD'autres éléments de décoration intérieure nous sont connus par l'archéologie et les textes. Ce sont d'abord les fameux taureaux androcéphales ailés sculptés en pierre caractéristiques des grands palais royaux assyriens, déjà été évoqués plus haut. Les textes de Sennacherib nous relatent aussi la réalisation de sculptures en métal de grande taille, réalisées avec une technique de type cire perdue : le palais était ainsi décoré d'un groupe de 8 lions de cuivre qui auraient pesé 11 400 talents chacun (soit environ 342 tonnes), et de 2 colonnes de bronze de 6 000 talents (180 tonnes).\nFinalement, la construction des palais royaux de Ninive a mobilisé de nombreuses richesses, des plus courantes comme les briques d'argiles ou les pierres calcaires disponibles en Assyrie même, jusqu'aux ressources plus rares et précieuses comme les essences de bois de qualité et les métaux et pierres précieux qui étaient obtenus par le biais des tributs versés par les vassaux des rois assyriens. Il s'agit une nouvelle fois de montrer la puissance du souverain, et la construction d'un grand palais est un exploit tout comme les victoires militaires qui sont illustrées sur ses bas-reliefs.\n\nLa cour\nAu-delà de leur intérêt architectural et artistique, les palais royaux de Ninive étaient conçus comme des centres de pouvoir destinés à commander le vaste empire assyrien à son apogée sous les trois derniers rois de la dynastie des Sargonides. Il est difficile d'y distinguer les deux espaces traditionnels des palais royaux assyriens, à savoir la zone privée (bītānu) où se trouvaient les appartements royaux et le harem, et la zone publique (bābānu) servant à l'administration palatiale et impériale. Le palais était le lieu de travail d'un grand nombre de domestiques, de scribes, mais aussi d'une foule de courtisans, d'eunuques, d'administrateurs, de prêtres, de gardes, dont le nombre a pu être évalué à 13 000 personnes pour le règne d'Assurbanipal. Le majordome (ša pān ekalli), aidé d'autres dignitaires, supervisait la gestion du palais royal, son approvisionnement et l'entretien des personnes qui s'y trouvaient. L'administration du royaume était aussi gérée depuis le palais. Les fonctions auliques n'étaient pas séparées strictement des fonctions administratives, puisqu'un personnage détenant une fonction qui à l'origine était une charge palatiale comme le grand échanson (rab šaqē) ou le chef cuisinier (rab nuhhatimi) étaient chargés d'une fonction administrative importante ou du gouvernement d'une province.\nLe pouvoir était donc concentré entre les mains d'un groupe de personnes proches du roi mais qui dépendaient de la faveur de ce dernier. Cela pouvait amener la création de factions à l'intérieur du palais, pour accéder au roi et chercher à l'influencer, mais créait des tensions en raison des changements qui pouvaient survenir dans les faveurs royales. Les courtisans les plus privilégiés, nommés manzaz pāni (littéralement « celui qui se tient devant »), étaient admis à la plupart des audiences royales. Une étiquette rigide régissait la vie du palais et l'accès à la personne royale, à sa salle du trône où se déroulaient les réceptions d'ambassadeurs étrangers, de hauts dignitaires, de responsables locaux, qui devaient se prosterner devant le souverain lors de ces audiences.\nLe harem était la zone réservée aux épouses du roi et aux filles de la famille royale non mariées, ainsi qu'aux enfants en bas âge. Elles étaient assistées par des servantes, des eunuques. Le harem était divisé en plusieurs maisons : une dirigée par la reine mère, dont l'influence peut être cruciale comme dans le cas de Zakutu, épouse de Sennacherib et reine mère au temps d'Assarhaddon et Assurbanipal ; celle de l'épouse principale ; celles des épouses secondaires importantes ; celles des sœurs du roi. Chacune de ces maisons disposait de son administration interne, de domaines fonciers générant des revenus. Il y a en plus bien d'autres femmes dépendant de la maisonnée du roi, notamment des musiciennes, et aussi des servantes, qui assurent leur fonctionnement. En pratique le harem d'un souverain n'étaient pas concentrés dans un seul palais, mais dans ses différents palais royaux, où étaient donc réparties les femmes de la maisonnée du roi.\n\nLes tablettes\nLes édifices du tell de Kuyunjik ont livré en tout plus de 30 000 tablettes et fragments, la plupart exhumés dès les premières campagnes de fouilles et datés de l'époque néo-assyrienne, même si quelques tablettes du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. ont été retrouvées. Certaines de ces découvertes, avant tout celle de la tablette relatant le récit du déluge de l'Épopée de Gilgamesh, traduite par George Smith en 1872, sont des faits marquants dépassant le cadre des études assyriologiques par leur retentissement. Une première partie du corpus est constituée de documents de la pratique, produits pour l'administration de l'empire assyrien ou pour des affaires privées de personnes généralement proches du pouvoir. Il s'agit de lettres, de documents juridiques enregistrant notamment des ventes de terres ou des prêts, des documents administratifs, quelques traités de paix, etc. Ces tablettes couvrent une longue période, dans la mesure où on y trouve même 1 200 lettres de la correspondance de Sargon II (722-705 av. J.-C.), bien qu'il ait régné depuis Dur-Sharrukin (elles ont probablement été déplacées à l’initiative de son successeur Sennacherib). Les documents les plus récents datent du règne de Sîn-shar-ishkun (625-612 av. J.-C.), donc juste avant la prise de la ville.\nUne grande partie des textes de Ninive est de type littéraire, même s'il convient de préciser le sens de ce terme par un aperçu de leur contenu et le but de leur rassemblement dans la zone des palais royaux. L'ensemble de ces tablettes est souvent regroupé sous le terme de « bibliothèque d'Assurbanipal », ce souverain ayant été très actif dans la constitution de cette collection. Il ne s'agit en fait pas d'une seule et même bibliothèque. Bien que l'origine des textes soit mal recensée car on ne prenait pas la peine de répertorier les lieux de découverte ni les tablettes lors des premières campagnes de fouilles qui furent les plus fructueuses, il est possible d'identifier vaguement quelques importants groupes de textes : un premier dans le palais sud-ouest, et un deuxième dans le palais nord, les colophons des tablettes de ces collections mentionnant seulement leur appartenance au « palais d'Assurbanipal » ; et un troisième dans le temple de Nabû, dieu des lettres, certains textes révélant qu'il disposait d'un lot de tablettes qui est d'ailleurs le seul explicitement qualifié de « bibliothèque » (girginakku), mais n'a cependant pu être repérée par les fouilles.\nLe but de ces bibliothèques n'était pas d'être des lieux de savoir pour le savoir, et ne traduisent pas une quelconque volonté encyclopédique de la part d'Assurbanipal, qui se présente souvent comme un souverain lettré dans ses inscriptions. Il s'agit en fait d'un ensemble de textes visant à assurer la protection du souverain : la grande majorité de ceux-ci sont de nature religieuse et rituelle, visant à défendre le roi contre les malheurs qui pourraient le toucher. Il a été évalué qu'il y avait environ 25 % de textes divinatoires, 20 % de tablettes de rituels, incantation et prières, et 20 % de listes lexicales. Les textes mythologiques ne sont qu'une très maigre portion du tout, marginale, à peine une quarantaine de tablettes. Pour constituer cette défense contre les forces surnaturelles, des confiscations de tablettes dans des bibliothèques de Babylonie ou même d'Assyrie furent ordonnées ; d'autres fois, les tablettes furent simplement copiées. Les lettrés responsables de ce corpus sont logiquement des prêtres, des devins ou des exorcistes.\n\nPostérité\nLe souvenir de Ninive\nNinive est mentionnée dans plusieurs textes dès l'Antiquité, qui ont été lus au cours des siècles postérieurs et ont préservé le souvenir de l'empire assyrien et de sa dernière capitale. Elle est évoquée par plusieurs écrivains grecs et romains qui s'en souvenaient comme de la capitale du grand empire assyrien, mais la décrivent peu en comparaison de Babylone, puis elle est tombée dans l'oubli et évoquée comme étant un champ de ruines par Lucien de Samosate. Il existe des confusions quant à sa localisation exacte : Ctésias de Cnide la confond avec Babylone en la situant sur l'Euphrate, les autres auteurs (Strabon, Pline l'Ancien, Ptolémée) la situent sur le Tigre mais tantôt sur la rive gauche, tantôt sur la rive droite, montrant le fait qu'ils sont souvent informés de façon imprécise. Les récits relatifs à Ninive chez les auteurs de l'Antiquité gréco-romaine reposent généralement sur ce qu'a rapporté Ctésias dans sa partie sur l'histoire de l'empire assyrien. Ninive devrait son nom à son fondateur, le souverain légendaire Ninos, premier roi assyrien et conquérant de nombreuses contrées. L'autre grand moment de l'histoire de la ville est sa destruction par les Mèdes et les Babyloniens qui poussent le tyran Sardanapale au suicide par l'incendie de son palais, après avoir pénétré dans la ville en provoquant une inondation. Ce récit repose apparemment sur une confusion entre la chute de Babylone en 648 av. J.-C. et celle de Ninive en 612 av. J.-C.\nDans la Bible hébraïque et chrétienne, Ninive est fondée par Nimrod. Les Assyriens ayant dominé les royaumes d'Israël et de Juda, son image y est négative. Les Livres de Nahum et de Sophonie prophétisent et décrivent sa destruction. Le Livre de Jonas est situé à Ninive : Jonas parvient à son grand dam à amener cette grande cité de pécheurs à faire pénitence. Ce texte ayant été rédigé bien après la chute de la ville, il ne contient aucune donnée historique fiable sur celle-ci. L'histoire de Jonas à Ninive connaît un grand succès, étant notamment reprise dans les Évangiles de Matthieu et Luc ; elle est devenue le texte auquel Ninive est le plus souvent associée dans la tradition juive, chrétienne puis musulmane. D'ailleurs, un lieu de culte dédié à Jonas fut érigé par une communauté chrétienne locale sur la colline qui reprit par la suite le nom du prophète, Nebi Yunus.\nPlus proches du site, les auteurs arabes médiévaux mentionnent l'emplacement de l'antique Ninive. Les histoires qu'ils évoquent sur son passé sont reprises des auteurs grecs et surtout de la Bible, car pour eux cette ville est avant tout le lieu où Jonas (Yunus) est venu faire sa mission de conversion. L'emplacement de Ninive est bien connu par les géographes médiévaux (Ibn Hawqal et Al-Maqdisi par exemple), grâce à la mosquée qui s'élève sur l'actuel Nebi Yunus (alors appelé Tall al-Tawba, la « Colline du repentir »). Une légende locale rapporte que le gigantesque poisson qui aurait conduit Yunus sur place est enterré sur le site. Sur ces bases, quelques voyageurs européens médiévaux et modernes (Benjamin de Tudèle au XIIe siècle, Carsten Niebuhr au XVIIIe siècle) peuvent localiser les ruines de Ninive.\n\nRéceptions modernes\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\nGénéralités sur la Mésopotamie antique\nFrancis Joannès (dir.), Dictionnaire de la civilisation mésopotamienne, Paris, Robert Laffont, coll. « Bouquins », 2001\nAgnès Benoit, Art et archéologie : les civilisations du Proche-Orient ancien, Paris, RMN, coll. « Manuels de l'école du Louvre », 2003\nJean-Louis Huot, Jean-Paul Thalmann et Dominique Valbelle, Naissance des cités, Paris, Nathan, coll. « Origines », 1990 (ISBN 2-09-294150-X)\nDominique Charpin, Lire et écrire à Babylone, Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 2008\n\nAssyrie\nFastes des palais assyriens : Au nouvel empire, Dijon, coll. « Les dossiers d'archéologie n° 171 », mai 1992\n(it) Frederick Mario Fales, L'impero assiro, storia e amministrazione (IX-VII secolo A.C.), Rome, Laterza, 2001\nFrancis Joannès, La Mésopotamie au Ier millénaire av.

      "summary": "Ninive (en akkadien Ninu(w)a ; en arabe نينوه, Naynuwa ; en araméen ܢܝܢܘܐ ; en hébreu נינוה, Nīnwē) est une ancienne ville de l'Assyrie, dans le Nord de la Mésopotamie. Elle se situait sur la rive est (gauche) du Tigre, au confluent du Khosr (ou Khoser, Koussour), à un emplacement aujourd'hui localisé dans les faubourgs de la ville moderne de Mossoul, en Irak, dont le centre se trouve de l'autre côté du fleuve. Les deux sites principaux de la cité sont les collines (les « tells ») de Kuyunjik et de Nebī Yūnus.\nNinive est l'une des plus anciennes cités de Mésopotamie. Elle était un important carrefour de routes commerciales traversant le Tigre. Elle occupait une position stratégique sur la grande route entre la mer Méditerranée et le plateau Iranien, ce qui lui a apporté la prospérité, de sorte qu'elle est devenue l'une des plus grandes cités de toute la région. Elle doit sa plus grande expansion urbaine au choix du roi assyrien Sennacherib d'en faire la capitale de son grand empire au début du VIIe siècle av. J.-C. Ninive est alors entourée de remparts de briques sur une longueur de 12 km. L'espace total de la cité couvrait 750 hectares à son apogée. L'ensemble de ce vaste espace est aujourd'hui une superposition de ruines recouvertes à certains endroits par les nouvelles banlieues actuelles de la ville de Mossoul. Depuis 2014 et la prise de contrôle de Mossoul par l'organisation terroriste État islamique, les ruines de Ninive ont fait l'objet d'importantes destructions.\nLe site de Kuyunjik occupe une place importante dans la redécouverte du Proche-Orient ancien au milieu du XIXe siècle par les archéologues qui mettent au jour ses palais et leurs bas-reliefs, ainsi que par les milliers de tablettes cunéiformes qui y ont été exhumées dès les premiers chantiers de fouilles et ont permis la naissance de la discipline assyriologique. Ce même tell présente la séquence archéologique la plus longue de la Mésopotamie, depuis les premières traces d'habitations au VIe millénaire av. J.-C. jusqu'aux dernières vers les XIIIe – XIVe siècles apr. J.-C. Les fouilles de Ninive ont donc livré une partie substantielle des sources des connaissances actuelles sur l'Empire assyrien et, plus largement, sur la culture de la Mésopotamie antique.",

      "content": "## Overview\nMosul (Arabic: الموصل‎ al-Mawṣil, Maṣlawī Arabic: al-Mōṣul, Assyrian: ܢܝܢܘܐ  Ninaweh, Kurdish: Mosul/Ninawa, Turkish: Musul) is a city in Iraq's Northwestern region, and is the country's second largest city by population. Its religious makeup is one of the most diverse in the country.\n\n## Understand\nMosul is Iraq's second largest city and the major economic hub in northern Iraq. Located along the fertile lands of river Tigris the city's history dates back to at least 6,000 BC. On the eastern banks lies the ancient city of Nineveh, which was the world's largest city around 700 BC. Mosul has since thrived under different rulers, empowered by its strategic position and fertile lands.\nIn recent history Mosul is mainly known for being the last stand of the Islamic State (ISIS). The fierce battle which took place during 2017 left large parts of the old city in ruins. While much of the city's heritage is destroyed, Maslawis are slowly rebuilding the city.\n\n## By bus\nFrom Baghdad: shared taxis are available from Allawi North garage in Baghdad. Cost is 25,000 IQD for a seat (likely 5,000 IQD extra for the front seat); the driver will usually cram in 4 passengers before leaving. The journey takes 4-5 hours.\nFrom Erbil: shared taxis are available at 10,000 IQD per seat. Journey takes 2-3 hours.\n36.33857143.1369331 Garage Baghdad. Garage where shared taxis to/from Baghdad depart and arrive.    (updated Oct 2022)\n36.3508543.172522 Mosul North Garage. Garage for northbound shared taxi departures, i.e. Erbil.    (updated Oct 2022)\n\n## By train\nAs of 2023 there's no rail service to Mosul, rehabilitation is however ongoing and the government has promised to bring back passenger trains from Baghdad.\n36.331443.12223 Mosul railway station (محطة قطار الموصل).     (updated Jun 2023)\n\n## By air\nAs of 2023, the airport is closed and not expected to reopen within the next few years. The nearest international airport is in Erbil, 75 km east of Mosul.\n36.29538943.1480564 Mosul International Airport (OSM  IATA). Closed as of 2021.      (updated Feb 2020)\n\n## Get around\nTravelling by car is the safest option for getting around in the city. Several bridges over the river Tigris have now been repaired, making the east-west journey much easier.\nThere's no public transport system within the city, apart from mini buses and shared taxis. Extensive knowledge of Arabic is needed to use these.\n\n## See\nMosul was rich in old historical places and ancient buildings: mosques, castles, churches, monasteries, synagogues, and schools, many of which have architectural features and decorative work of significance. The town centre was dominated by a maze of streets and attractive 19th-century houses. There were old houses here of beauty. Markets were particularly interesting for the mixture of people who jostle there, such as Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Turcoman, Armenians, Yazidi, Mandeans, Roma and Shabaks. Mosul also had a sizable Jewish population.\n\n## Mosques and shrines\nMosul is a treasure trove for those interested in historic Islamic religious architecture with dozens of mosques dating back hundreds of years. However many are in a state of disrepair or damaged by the war. Also some mosques might be off limit to visit for non-Muslims.\n36.34298943.1269291 Great Mosque of al-Nuri (جامع النوري). Tradition holds that Nur ad-Din Zangi, a Turkoman atabeg of the Great Seljuk Empire and sultan of its Syrian province, built the mosque in 1172–1173, shortly before his death. the remarkably elaborate brickwork 52-m high minaret that leans like the Tower of Pisa, called Al-Hadba (\"the hunchback\"). It was destroyed during the last days of the Battle of Mosul in 2017. As of 2020, reconstruction efforts are ongoing.      (updated Feb 2020)\n36.34027943.1405912 Mujahidi Mosque. Dates back to 12th century AD, and is distinguished for its shen dome and elaborately wrought mihrab. Large parts of it was destroyed by ISIS in 2015.      (updated Mar 2019)\n36.35757943.1417043 Mosul Grand Mosque (جامع الموصل الكبير). A modern mosque still under construction on the right side of Tigris.      (updated Jan 2020)\n36.35455243.1227044 Mausoleum of Yahya Abu al-Qasim. On the right bank of the Tigris, known for its conical dome, decorative brickwork and calligraphy engraved in Mosul blue marble, built in the 13th century. Largely destroyed by ISIS in 2014.      (updated Jan 2020)\n36.34828143.1598725 Mosque of the Prophet Yunus. A site with a shared Jewish, Christian and Islamic heritage, this is the supposed burial place of Prophet Jonah. Located on a prominent mound just south of the Nineveh, the site formerly housed both the palace of King Esarhaddon (681-669 BCE) and an Assyrian church. However, a mosque was constructed on the site in the 12th century. The mosque was largely destroyed by ISIS in 2014, but parts of it remain.    (updated Feb 2020)\n36.339643.12866 Al-Raabiya Mosque. Built in 1766 with an impressive decorated dome. The site was damaged during the war but it being rebuild in 2021.  (updated Jun 2021)\n\n## Churches and monasteries\nMosul had the largest proportion of Assyrian Christians of all the Iraqi cities, and contains several interesting old churches, some of which originally date back to the early centuries of Christianity. Its ancient Assyrian churches are often hidden and their entrances in thick walls are not easy to find. Many churches were partly or completely destroyed by ISIS during their rule and as of 2020 many are in ruins. Also, dotted around Mosul are ancient monasteries, some in ruins while others are still active.\n36.33801743.1259947 Shamoun Al-Safa (St. Peter, Mar Petros). Oldest church in Mosul, it dates from the 13th century and named after Shamoun Al-Safa or St. Peter. Early, it had the name of the two Apostles, Peter and Paul, and had early been inhabited by the nuns of the Sacred Hearts.    (updated Nov 2020)\n36.34141143.1253548 Church of St. Thomas (Mar Touma). One of the oldest historical churches, named after St. Thomas the Apostle who preached the Gospel in the East, including India.      (updated May 2018)\n36.34055643.1272229 Our Lady of the Hour Church (كنيسة اللاتين). Also known as the Latin Church by locals. Built in the 1870s with an impressive clock tower, this large Latin church was partially destroyed by ISIS in 2015. The church has however been faithfully restored to much of its former glory.   (updated Jan 2022)\n36.34455643.13263910 Al-Tahera Church. A Syriac Catholic church completed in 1862, it was severely damaged in 2017 but has since then been restored. The church was built on top the Ancient al-Tahera Church, dating back to the 7th century but last reconstructed in 1743. The old church can still be visited, located three metres below ground level   (updated Nov 2020)\n36.33858643.12563911 Mart Meskinta Chaldean Church. Chaldean Catholic church dating back to the 12th century, latest major remodeling was in 1851.   (updated Jan 2024)\nMar Petion Church. Mar Petion, educated by his cousin in a monastery, was martyred in 446 AD. It is the first Chaldean Catholic church in Mosul, after the union of many Assyrians with Rome in the 17th century. It dates back to the 10th century, and lies 3 m below street level. This church suffered destruction, and it has been reconstructed many times. (updated Jan 2020)\nMar Hudeni Church. Named after Mar Ahudemmeh (Hudeni) Maphrian of Tikrit who martyred in 575 AD. Mar Hudeni is an old church of the Tikritans in Mosul. It dates back to the 10th century, lies 7 metres below street and was first reconstructed in 1970. People can get mineral water from the well in its yard. The chain, fixed in the wall, is thought to cure epileptics. (updated Jan 2020)\n36.409743.119712 St. George's Monastery (Mar Gurguis). One of the oldest churches in Mosul, named after St. George, was probably built late in the 17th century. Pilgrims from different parts of the North visit it yearly in the spring, when many people also go out to its whereabouts on holiday. It is about 6 metres below street. A modern church was built over the old one in 1931, abolishing much of its archeological significance. The only monuments left are a marble door-frame decorated with a carved Estrangelo (Syriac) inscription, and two niches, which date back to the 13th or 14th century.   (updated Jan 2022)\n36.340143.126413 Anglican Church. One of very few Anglican churches in Iraq. Badly damaged during the war but has since been rebuilt. Parts of the intricate ornaments remains.
