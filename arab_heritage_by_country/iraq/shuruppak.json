      "content": "Shuruppak (Sumerian: 𒋢𒆳𒊒𒆠 ŠuruppagKI, SU.KUR.RUki, \"the healing place\"), modern Tell Fara, was an ancient Sumerian city situated about 55 kilometres (35 mi) south of Nippur and 30 kilometers north of ancient Uruk on the banks of the Euphrates in Iraq's Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate. Shuruppak was dedicated to Ninlil, also called Sud, the goddess of grain and the air. The Early Dynastic IIIa period is also sometimes called the Fara period. Not to be confused with the Levantine archaeological site Tell el-Far'ah (South).\n\"Shuruppak\" is sometimes also the name of a king of the city, legendary survivor of the Flood, and supposed author of the Instructions of Shuruppak\".\n\nHistory\nJemdet Nasr period\nThe earliest excavated levels at Shuruppak date to the Jemdet Nasr period about 3000 BC. Several objects made of arsenical copper were found in Shuruppak/Fara dating to the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 2900 BC). Similar objects were also found at Tepe Gawra (levels XII-VIII).\n\nEarly Dynastic II\nThe city rose in importance and size, exceeding 40 hectares(0.4km2), during the Early Dynastic period.\nIn the Sumerian King List is a ruler, Ubara-Tutu, the last ruler \"before the flood\". In some versions he is followed by a son, Ziusudra. In later versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh, a man named Utnapishtim, son of Ubara-Tutu, is noted to be king of Shuruppak. This portion of Gilgamesh is thought to have been taken from another literary composition, the Myth of Atrahasis.\n\nEarly Dynastic III\nThe city expanded to its greatest extent at the end of the Early Dynastic III period (2600 BC to 2350 BC) when it covered about 100 hectares.\nCuneiform tablets from the Early Dynastic III period show a thriving, military oriented economy with links to cities throughout the region. It has been proposed that Fara was part of a \"hexapolis\" with Lagash, Nippur, Uruk, Adab, and Umma, possibly under the leadership of Kish. It has been proposed that in the Early Dynastic IIIa period Shuruppak had passed from the control of Kish to that of Uruk and was part of joint military operations against Kish (with Adab, Nippur, Lagaš, Umma) under the leadership of Uruk.\n\nAkkadian period\nIn the Akkadian Period (c. 2334–2154 BC), Shuruppak was ruled by a governor holding the title patesi. Like most cities on the Euphrates, it declined during the Akkadian Empire. A clay cone from the Akkadian Empire period found at Shurappak read \"Dada, governor of Suruppak: Hala-adda, gover[nor] of Suruppak, his son, laid the ... of the city gate of the goddess Sud\".\nGovernors: Dada; Hala-adda;\n\nUr III period\nDuring Ur III period (c. 2112-2004 BC), the city was ruled by a governors (ensi2) appointed by Ur. One is known to be Ur-nigar, son of Shulgi, first rulers of Ur III. One of the tablets found at the site is dated by a year name to the beginning of the reign of Shu-Sin, next to last ruler of Ur III. A few governors of Shurappak under the Ur III Empire are known from contemporary epigraphic remains, Ku-Nanna, Lugal-hedu, Ur-nigin-gar, and Ur-Ninkura. In much later literary compositions several purported rulers are mentioned.\n\nMiddle Bronze I\nIn the 2020s BC, the Ur III Empire was hit by a major drought. It is thought to have been abandoned shortly around 2000 BC.\nA Isin-Larsa cylinder seal and several pottery plaques which may date to early in the second millennium BC were found at the site. Surface finds are predominantly Early Dynastic. In the 2nd year of Enlil-bani (c. 1860–1837 BC), ruler of Isin, a sage of Nippur is recorded as leaving an herbal medicine at Shurappak.\n\nFlood Myth\nThe report of the 1930s excavation mentions a layer of flood deposits at the end of the Jemdet Nasr period at Shuruppak. Shuruppak in Mesopotamian legend is one of the \"antediluvian\" cities and the home of King Utnapishtim, who survives the flood by making a boat beforehand. Schmidt wrote that the flood story of the Bible,seems to be based on a very real event or a series of such, as suggested by the existence at Ur, at Kish, and now at Fara, of inundation deposits, which accumulated on top of human inhabitation. There is finally “the Noah story,” which may possibly symbolize the survival of the Sumerian culture and the end of the Elamite Jemdet Nasr culture. The deposit is like that deposited by river avulsions, a process that was common in the Tigris–Euphrates river system.\n\nArchaeology\nTell Fara extends about a kilometer from north to south. The total area is about 120 hectares, with about 35 hectares of the mound being more than three meters above the surrounding plain, with a maximum of 9 meters. The site consists of two mounds, one larger than the other, separated by an old canal bed as well as a lower town. It was visited by William Loftus in 1850. Hermann Volrath Hilprecht conducted a brief survey in 1900. He found \"copper goatheads; a copper, pre-Sargonid sword; a lamp in the shape of a bird; a very archaic seal cylinder; a number of\npre-Sargonid tablets, and 60 incised plates of mother of pearl\".\nIt was first excavated between 1902 and 1903 by Walter Andrae, Robert Koldewey and Friedrich Delitzsch of the German Oriental Society for eight months. They used a new \"modern\" system which involved excavating trenches 8 feet wide and 5 feet deep every few yards running across the entire width of the larger mound. If a building wall was found in a trench it was further explored. Preliminary identification of the site as Suruppak came from a Ur III period clay nail which mentioned \"Haladda, son of Dada, the patesi of Shuruppak (written SU.KUR.RUki)\nrepaired the ADUS of the Great Gate of the god Shuruppak (written\ndSU.KUR.RU-da)\". Among other finds, 847 cuneiform tablets and 133 tablet fragments of Early Dynastic III period were collected, which ended up in the Berlin Museum and the Istanbul Museum. They included administrative, legal, lexical, and literary texts. Over 100 of the tablets dealt with the disbursement of rations to workers. About a thousand Early Dynastic clay sealings and fragments (used to secure doors and containers) were also found. Most from cylinder seals but 19 were from stamp seals. In 1903 the site was visited by Edgar James Banks who was excavating at the site of Adab, a four-hour walk to the north. Banks took photographs of the German trenches and noted a 20 foot in diameter well, constructed with plano-convex bricks, in the center of the larger mound as well as an arched sewer, similarly constructed. The latter was where tablets were found. Banks also noted that the smaller mound held a cemetery.\n\nIn 1926 it was visited by Raymond P, Dougherty during his archaeological survey of the region. In March and April 1931, a joint team of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the University of Pennsylvania excavated Shuruppak for a further six week season, with Erich Schmidt as director and with epigraphist Samuel Noah Kramer being prompted by reports of illicit excavations in the area. They were able to stratify the major occupation levels as Jemdat Nasr (Fara I), Early Dynastic (Fara II), and Ur III empire (Fara III). There was an \"inundation event\" between Fara I and Fara II. The excavation recovered 96 tablets and fragments—mostly from pre-Sargonic times—biconvex, and unbaked. The tablets included reference to Shuruppak enabling confirmation of the sites original name.\n\nIn 1973, a three-day surface survey of the site was conducted by Harriet P. Martin. Consisting mainly of pottery shard collection, the survey confirmed that Shuruppak dates at least as early as the Jemdet Nasr period, expanded greatly in the Early Dynastic period, and was also an element of the Akkadian Empire and the Third Dynasty of Ur.\nA surface survey and a full magnetometer survey of the site was completed was conducted between 2016 and 2018 by a team from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich led by Adelheid Otto and Berthold Einwag. The initial work was under the regional QADIS survey. A drone was used to create a digital elevation model of the site. The researchers found thousands of robber holes left by looters which had disturbed surface in many places, with the top several meters of the main mound destroyed. They were able to use remains of the 900 meter long trench left by excavators in 1902 and 1903 to orient old excavation documents and aerial mapping with their geomagnetic results. Part of the site was inaccessible because of the spoil heaps from the excavations. A city wall was found (in Area A), which had been missed in the past. A harbor and quay were also found.\nFurther excavations seasons occurred in 2022 and 2024. Work occurred in an area where the early German excavators found over 1000 seal impressions from about 500 seals (trench Id/Ie), in an area now heavily looted out. The seals covered a wide period, Jemdet Nasr, ED I and ED II so it was assumed the area was a rubbish dump. A location was chosen where sand encroachment had somewhat deterred the robbers. a trench was excavated measuring 4 meters long by 3 meters wide, to a depth of 2.5 meters without reaching virgin soil. A total of 180 clay sealings were found often matching those earlier excavated including an unusually large seal (3.5 centimeters) in the \"Elegant Style\". Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analysis of clay sealings suggested that rather than being deposited over a long period of time all of the various seal styles were being used at the same time.\n\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nInstructions of Shuruppak\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAndrae, W., \"Aus einem Berichte W.

      "content": "Shuruppak (écrit aussi Šuruppak ou Curuppag) est une ancienne ville sumérienne située en Mésopotamie, dont la principale phase d'occupation correspond au IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. Le site de la cité se trouve à 175 kilomètres au sud-est de Bagdad, sur le site de Tell Fara. Le site archéologique couvre environ 225 hectares, mais la ville lors de son extension maximale a sans doute couvert au maximum une centaine d'hectares.\nLa ville de Shuruppak était consacrée à Ninlil, la déesse du blé et de l'air. Le roi sumérien semi-légendaire Uta-Napishtim, parfois considéré comme l'homologue de Noé dans la mythologie mésopotamienne, y aurait vécu. La tradition babylonienne y place aussi son héros Atrahasis, équivalent d'Uta-Napishtim.\n\nFouilles\nLe site de Fara a été repéré par l'explorateur britannique W. K. Loftus en 1850, puis par W. H. Ward en 1885 et l'archéologue allemand H. Hilprecht en 1900. \nLes fouilles régulières sur le site ont débuté en 1902 à l'initiative de la Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft (DOG) récemment fondée. Celle-ci est dirigée par Robert Koldewey qui opère depuis Babylone et dépêche des missions temporaires sur d'autres site, dont Fara, où se rendent Ernst Heinrich et Walter Andrae. Ces fouilles durent neuf mois, employant environ 200 hommes, chargés de creuser une vingtaine de tranchées, permettant de localiser plusieurs bâtiments identifiés comme des résidences, des maisons organisées autour de cours selon le modèle le plus répandu en Mésopotamie antique. Les résultats des fouilles sont publiés en 1931. \nLe site est à nouveau fouillé en 1931 sous la direction d'Erich Schmidt, pour le compte de l'Université de Pennsylvanie, durant 3 mois. Il explore plusieurs résidences, ainsi que des silos. Les résultats de ces fouilles sont repris par Harriet Martin à partir de 1968, qui conduit également une exploration de surface sur le site afin de repérer les lieux de découverte et de mieux déterminer les phases d'occupation.\n\nPériodes d'occupation\nBien que retenue par la tradition sumérienne comme étant une des villes ayant eu la royauté dans les temps antédiluviens, Shuruppak ne semble pas avoir été une ville ancienne. Le site de Fara s'est surtout développé au IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. Un sondage effectué lors des fouilles de l'Université de Pennsylvanie a permis d'identifier une occupation remontant à l'époque de Djemdet Nasr, v. 3000-2900 av. J.-C. La ville connaît un développement marqué dans les siècles suivants, au début de la période des dynasties archaïques (DA), durant la phase I (v. 2900-2750 av. J.-C.). Durant la phase DA IIIA (v. 2600-2500 av. J.-C.), la ville couvre une centaine d'hectares, ce qui correspond à son extension maximale. C'est par ailleurs la période la plus connue par les sources épigraphiques. Le site est encore occupé durant les époques suivantes, celle d'Akkad (v. 2350-2150 av. J.-C.) et d'Ur III (v. 2120-2004 av. J.-C.) durant lesquelles Shuruppak est une bourgade provinciale, déclinante. Elle est encore occupée à la période d'Isin-Larsa (v. 2004-1750 av. J.-C.), sans doute sur une surface réduite. Le site est abandonné par la suite, et ne semble connaître qu'une occupation ponctuelle au XVIIIe siècle av. J.-C..\n\nUne cité archaïque importante\nSi elle n'a pas compté parmi les principales cités sumériennes dans la tradition postérieure, au même titre que Ur, Uruk et Nippur, Shuruppak n'en a pas moins été une cité importante. La Liste royale sumérienne la considère comme une des premières cités à avoir exercé la royauté durant les premiers temps, juste avant le Déluge. C'est un certain Ubara-Tutu qui aurait alors exercé la royauté, et régné quelque 18 600 ans. Son successeur Ziusudra est le personnage principal du récit sumérien du Déluge. Un autre texte littéraire sumérien de premier plan, les Instructions de Shuruppak, se présente comme une collection de conseils de sagesse dispensés par un personnage appelé Shuruppak, comme la ville, présenté comme le fils d'Ubara-tutu et le père de Ziusudra. \nDans le domaine religieux, Shuruppak est la cité tutélaire de la déesse Sud, qui fut assimilée à la déesse Ninlil, épouse du grand dieu Enlil. On y trouvait son temple, appelé é-dim-gal-an-na (« Maison, grand lien du Ciel »). Des hymnes indiquent par ailleurs que la déesse Inanna/Ishtar disposait d'un temple important dans cette ville, appelé é-nìgin-gar-ra « (Maison, chambre établie »).\n\nLes sources textuelles\nEnviron 800 tablettes d'argile et 1 300 empreintes de sceaux (servant surtout pour sceller des portes), datant essentiellement de la période DA IIIA (v. 2600-2500 av. J.-C.), ont été mises au jour lors des premières fouilles de Fara et de fouilles clandestines, faisant de ce site l'un des mieux documentés pour cette période reculée. En particulier, la diversité des sources épigraphiques (textes administratifs, privés, scolaires, religieux) est remarquable, témoignant d'une diversification des usages de l'écriture. Les lots de tablettes proviennent de différentes résidences (une vingtaine de lieux de trouvailles), en particulier la « Maison aux tablettes » (tranchée XVh).\nLes textes de Shuruppak ne livrent pas d'informations claires sur la situation politique de la ville. Aucun roi local n'est attesté avec certitude dans les archives, et il semblerait que la cité ait été placée dans la mouvance de la principale puissance politique de la partie septentrionale du Sud mésopotamie, Kish ; le « roi » (lugal) mentionné dans les textes pourrait donc être celui de cette cité. F. Pomponio et G. Visicato ont identifié dans les textes et les sceaux de Fara une forme d'organisation politique qu'ils ont qualifié d'« hexapole », une alliance économique et militaire (une sorte d'amphictyonie) impliquant Shuruppak et les autres principales cités sumériennes (Adab, Lagash, Nippur, Umma, Uruk) et sans doute Kish. Cette institution contrôlerait une partie de l'administration de Shuruppak, ou y aurait son administration, et travaillerait en coordination avec les cités partenaires, notamment dans le domaine militaire, puisque les textes font référence à des soldats provenant de plusieurs de ces cités (réunies pour des raisons indéterminées). Ces textes documentent une période limitée dans le temps, trois ans au maximum, et pourraient donc renseigner sur une situation très particulière liée à la domination de Kish sur plusieurs cités de Sumer, gérée depuis Shuruppak. La documentation ne permet cependant pas de confirmer cette hypothèse.\nLes lots d'archives les plus importants sont de nature administrative. Ils concernent la gestion de champs (liste de champs, livraison de semence), d'équipes de travailleurs rémunérés par des rations, des offrandes aux temples, enregistrement de mouvements de divers produits (denrées alimentaires, animaux, métaux, bois, etc.). Shuruppak était alors dirigée par un roi, dont le nom n'est pas connu, portant le titre de lugal, qui est peut-être celui de Kish comme vu plus haut, notamment parce que ce titre est plutôt attesté dans cette ville que dans les cités sumériennes. Les dignitaires qui reviennent le plus souvent dans ces documents sont des administrateurs appelés GAR.ensí, dirigés par un personnage appelé GAR.ensí.gal (« Grand GAR.ensí »). Ils s'occupent des « bureaux » administratifs dont les archives ont été mises au jour. Leurs fonctions semblent temporaires, puisque les textes mentionnent des « tours » ou « rotations » (bala) effectuées par ces dignitaires. Les institutions encadrant la société et l'économie, sans doute dans le cadre plus vaste de l'hexapole évoquée plus haut, qui apparaissent dans ces textes sont le Palais (é-gal) et la « Maison de la Ville » (é-uru), cette dernière institution étant une spécificité de Shuruppak pour cette période. À la différence des autres cités sumériennes connues pour la période archaïque, aucun temple n'apparaît dans ces archives en tant qu'institution majeure de la ville. \nCes institutions encadraient leurs travailleurs, notamment des corvéables, qui étaient organisés en équipes dirigées par des chefs. Cette organisation renvoie du reste à celle de l'armée, qui apparaît dans des documents relatifs à des opérations militaires, puisque les travailleurs comme les soldats sont désignés comme des « corvéables » (guruš). Le royaume de Shuruppak pouvait donc lever des conscrits, mais il disposait apparemment aussi d'une forme d'armée permanente, organisée autour d'un régiment d'environ 700 hommes, divisé en bataillons de 60 ou 100 soldats dirigés par un capitaine (nu-banda), eux-mêmes subdivisés en unités d'une dizaine d'hommes dirigées par des officiers (ugula-nam-10, « chef d'une dizaine »).\nOn a par ailleurs identifié dans la partie nord du site de Fara, lors des fouilles allemandes, une trentaine de silos à grains d'une capacité moyenne de 100 m3 qui devaient être gérés par les institutions évoquées ci-dessus. Ils apparaissent dans les textes sous le nom de ganum. Plusieurs documents administratifs indiquent que l'orge qui y était stockée était distribuée sous forme de rations aux travailleurs dépendants des institutions, notamment les équipes d’agriculteurs, suivant la pratique habituelle en Mésopotamie antique. On a pu estimer que l'ensemble de ces silos, s'ils étaient remplis complètement, pouvaient contenir de quoi fournir des rations à 20 000 personnes pendants six mois. Il est cependant vraisemblable que ces installations n'aient eu vocation à servir que périodiquement.\nLa cinquantaine de textes « privés » retrouvée à Shuruppak sont des contrats concernant la vente de champs et de maisons, parfois des esclaves. Il n'est pas clair s'il s'agit de propriétés privées, car il semble que dans bien des cas il s'agisse de sortes de propriétés collectives, indivises. Cette documentation offre en tout cas un aperçu sur l'existence de transactions économiques en dehors du cadre institutionnel.\nLes autres documents écrits provenant de Fara sont de nature savante. On trouve d'abord des listes lexicales, caractéristiques du milieu intellectuel mésopotamien, ainsi que des tables numériques servant pour le calcul, des textes de rituels d'exorcisme, et des copies scolaires de textes littéraires.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\n(en) Harriet P.

Le site archéologique couvre environ 225 hectares, mais la ville lors de son extension maximale a sans doute couvert au maximum une centaine d'hectares.\nLa ville de Shuruppak était consacrée à Ninlil, la déesse du blé et de l'air. Le roi sumérien semi-légendaire Uta-Napishtim, parfois considéré comme l'homologue de Noé dans la mythologie mésopotamienne, y aurait vécu. La tradition babylonienne y place aussi son héros Atrahasis, équivalent d'Uta-Napishtim.",
