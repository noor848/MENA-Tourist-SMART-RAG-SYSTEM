      "content": "Ctesiphon ( TESS-if-on; Middle Persian: 𐭲𐭩𐭮𐭯𐭥𐭭, Tyspwn or Tysfwn; Persian: تیسفون; Ancient Greek: Κτησιφῶν, Attic Greek: [ktɛːsipʰɔ̂ːn]; Syriac: ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ) was an ancient city in modern Iraq, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, about 35 kilometres (22 mi) southeast of Baghdad. Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Iranian empires for over eight hundred years, in the Parthian and Sasanian periods. Ctesiphon was the administrative capital of the Sasanian Empire from 226–637 until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD.\nCtesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as \"The Cities\" (Mahuza, Arabic: المدائن, romanized: al-Mada'in). In the late 6th and early 7th century, it was listed as the largest city in the world by some accounts.\nDuring the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell once during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion and conquest, the city fell into decline and was depopulated by the end of the 8th century, its place as a political and economic center being taken by Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.\n\nNames\nThe Latin name Ctesiphon derives from Ancient Greek Ktēsiphôn (Κτησιφῶν). This is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as Tisfōn or Tisbōn. In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as Tyspwn, which can be read as Tīsfōn, Tēsifōn, etc. in Manichaean Parthian, in Middle Persian 𐭲𐭩𐭮𐭯𐭥𐭭 and in Christian Sogdian (in Syriac alphabet) languages. The New Persian form is Tisfun (تیسفون).\nTexts from the Church of the East's synods referred to the city as Qṭēspōn (Classical Syriac: ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ) or some times Māḥôzē (Classical Syriac: ܡܚܘܙ̈ܐ) when referring to the metropolis of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.\nIn modern Arabic, the name is usually Ṭaysafūn (طيسفون) or Qaṭaysfūn (قطيسفون) or as al-Mada'in (المدائن \"The Cities\", referring to Greater Ctesiphon). \"According to Yāqūt [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn.\" The Armenian name of the city was Tizbon (Տիզբոն). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the Book of Ezra of the Old Testament as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name Cas, and a cognate of Caspian and Qazvin). It is also mentioned in the Talmud as Aktisfon. In another Talmudic reference it is written as Akistfon, located across the Tigris River from the city of Ardashir.\n\nLocation\nCtesiphon is located approximately at Al-Mada'in, 35 km (22 mi) southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of a 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial Rome.\nThe archway of Chosroes (Taq Kasra) was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD. It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of Salman Pak.\n\nHistory\nParthian period\nCtesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by Mithridates I of Parthia. The reign of Gotarzes I saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58 BC during the reign of Orodes II. Gradually, the city merged with the old Hellenistic capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.\nThe reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals (Mithradatkirt, and Hecatompylos at Hyrcania) to the Scythian incursions.\nStrabo abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:\n\nIn ancient times Babylon was the metropolis of Assyria; but now Seleucia is the metropolis, I mean the Seleucia on the Tigris, as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the Scythian folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at Ecbatana and in Hyrcania because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.\nBecause of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the Roman Empire in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome four or five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor Trajan captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, Hadrian, decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general Avidius Cassius captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor Septimius Severus sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.\n\nSasanian period\nBy 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the Sasanian Empire, who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as al-Mada'in, and in Aramaic as Mahoze. The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Islamic Arabic sources is called \"the Old City\" (مدينة العتيقة Madīnah al-'Atīqah), where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace (قصر الأبيض), was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Asbānbar or Aspānbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. Taq Kasra was located in the latter.\nThe western side was known as Veh-Ardashir (meaning \"the good city of Ardashir\" in Middle Persian), known as Mahoza by the Jews, Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the Nestorian patriarch. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was Valashabad. Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.\nSeverus Alexander advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by Herodian, his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against Ardashir I. In 283, emperor Carus sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. Some historians have claimed that Galerius marched on Ctesiphon and was able to capture it. However, this is never explicitly stated in any source and is still a matter of debate among scholars.\nHence that he returned it to the Persian king Narses in exchange for Armenia and western Mesopotamia is also likely to have never happened. In c. 325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the Church of the East.\n\nAfter the conquest of Antioch in 541, Khosrow I built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city Veh-Antiok-Xusrō, or literally, \"better than Antioch Khosrow built this\". Local inhabitants of the area called the new city Rumagan, meaning \"town of the Romans\" and Arabs called the city al-Rumiyya. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrow built a number of fortified cities. After a campaign in 573, John of Ephesus wrote that no fewer than 292,000 persons had been deported from Dara, Apamia, and other Syrian towns to Veh-Antiokh. John would later cite a letter stating no more than 30,000 prisoners were deported. It's thought that the first number he gave is not to be taken literally.\nIn 590, a member of the House of Mihran, Bahram Chobin repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler Khosrow II from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrow II, with aid from the Byzantine Empire, reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrow's new winter residence, Dastagerd. In 627, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrow's son and successor, Kavad II.\nIn 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper Shahrbaraz, but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrow II's daughter Borandukht. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the House of Ispahbudhan and the Parsig (Persian) faction under Piruz Khosrow.\n\nDownfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests\nIn the mid-630s, the Muslim Arabs, who had invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in early 637.\nThe Muslim military officer Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas quickly seized Valashabad and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of Veh-Antiok-Xusrō and Veh-Ardashir. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Veh-Antiok-Xusrō were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (jizya). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the Sasanian royal family, nobles, and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops. Furthermore, the throne hall in Taq Kasra was briefly used as a mosque.\nStill, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the Abbasid capital at Baghdad in the 760s, and soon became a ghost town. Caliph Al-Mansur took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast. Al-Mansur also used the al-Rumiya town as the Abbasid capital city for a few months.\nIt is believed to be the basis for the city of Isbanir in One Thousand and One Nights.\n\nModern era\nThe ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of a major battle of World War I in November 1915. The Ottoman Empire defeated troops of Britain attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some 40 miles (64 km) before trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender.\n\nPopulation and religion\nUnder Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch Mar Babai I, fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the Merv metropolis as pivot. The population also included Manicheans, a dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during Umayyad rule fixing their \"patriarchate of Babylon\" there. Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after the Arab capture of the metropolis. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided Ali with presents, which he, however, refused to take. In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk Road, in Samarkand.\n\nArchaeology\nA German Oriental Society expedition led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site. In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma'aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za'tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the University of Turin directed by Antonio Invernizzi and Giorgio Gullini worked at the part of the site on the other side of the Tigris, which they identified as Veh Ardashir. Work mainly concentrated on restoration at the palace of Khosrow II. In 2013, the Iraqi government contracted to restore the Taq Kasra, as a tourist attraction.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nOpis\nAchaemenid Empire\nRachae\nSasanian Empire\nSchool of Seleucia-Ctesiphon\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nM.

      "content": "المدائن أو طيسفون وأصلها طوسفون وتعرف كذلك باسم قطيسفون أو طسيفون (بالآرامية: ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ) (باليونانية: Κτησιφῶν) (بالفارسية: تيسفون) أو المدائن؛ مدينة عراقية بناها الإغريق قبل الميلاد وورثها الفرس، والتي بَقَت مركزًا رئيسيًا للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في القرن الثامن. وكانت عاصمة الساسانيين والفرثيين. بنيت المدينة على الضفة الشرقية لنهر دجلة قرب بلدة المدائن/سلمان باك الحالية ما يقارب ال35 كم جنوب شرق بغداد. يقع موقع طيسفون قرب موقع مدينة سلوقية الأثرية التي بناها السلوقيون. من أشهر معالم طيسفون بناء طاق كسرى أو إيوان كسرى الذي كان مقر الحكم الساساني.\n\nالموقع\nتقع مدينة طسيفون في منطقة المدائن تقريبًا، على بُعد 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلًا) جنوب شرق مدينة بغداد الحديثة في العراق، على ضفاف نهر دجلة. بلغت مساحتها 30 كيلومترًا مربعًا، أي أكثر من ضعف مساحة روما الإمبراطورية في القرن الرابع الميلادي التي بلغت مساحتها 13.7 كيلومترًا مربعًا.\nكان إيوان كسرى (طاق كسرى) جزءًا من القصر الملكي في طسيفون ويُقدّر تاريخه بين القرنين الثالث والسادس الميلاديين. ويقع فيما يُعرف اليوم بمدينة سلمان باك العراقية.\n\nتاريخ\nالفترة البارثية\nتأسست طسيفون في أواخر القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد. وبُنيت على موقع مخيّمٍ عسكري أقامه مهرداد الأول ملك بارثيا قبالة سلوقية. وبلغت ذروة مجدها كمركز سياسي وتجاري في عهد غوتارزيس الأول. غدت المدينة عاصمة الإمبراطورية نحو عام 58 قبل الميلاد في عهد أورود الثاني. واندمجت تدريجيًا مع العاصمة الهلنستية القديمة سلوقية، وغيرها من المستوطنات المجاورة لتشكل مدينة عالمية متعددة الثقافات.\nيرجع السبب جزئيًا في نقل العاصمة غربًا، إلى قرب العواصم السابقة (نسا، وقومس في هيركانيا) من غزوات السكوثيين ربما.\n\nيصف إسطرابون تأسيس طسيفون على نحوٍ مفصل:«كانت بابل عاصمة آشور في العصور القديمة؛ أما الآن فهي سلوقية، وأعني سلوقية على نهر دجلة، كما تُسمى. وتقع بالقرب منها قرية تُدعى طسيفون، وهي قريةٌ كبيرة. اعتاد الملوك البارثيون جعل هذه القرية مقر إقامتهم الشتوي، ليستبقوا على السلوقيين حتى لا يُضطهدوا نتيجة إيوائهم الشعب أو الجنود السكوثيين بينهم. وبسبب قوة البارثيين، باتت طسيفون مدينة أكثر منها قرية؛ فحجمها كبير لدرجة أنها تؤوي عددًا كبيرًا من السكان، وقد جهزها البارثيون أنفسهم بالمباني؛ وزودوها بالبضائع للتجارة، وبالفنون التي تُرضي البارثيين. إذ اعتاد الملوك منهم قضاء الشتاء هناك بسبب الهواء الصحي، لكنهم كانوا يقضون الصيف في إكباتانا وهيركانيا بسبب سيادتهم القديمة في تلك المناطق».كانت طسيفون هدفًا عسكريًا رئيسًا لقادة الإمبراطورية الرومانية في حروبهم الشرقية نظرًا لأهميتها. واستولت روما على المدينة أربع أو خمس مرات في تاريخها، ثلاث منها في القرن الثاني. واستولى الإمبراطور تراجان عليها في عام 116، لكن خليفته هادريان قرر إعادتها طواعيةً في عام 117 كجزء من تسوية سلميّة. واستولى الجنرال الروماني أفيديوس كاسيوس على طسيفون في عام 164 خلال حرب بارثية أخرى هي الحرب الرومانية الفرثية (161-166)، لكنه تخلى عنها عند إبرام السلام. وفي عام 197، نهب الإمبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس طسيفون وأسر آلافًا من سكانها وباعهم كعبيد.\n\nالفترة الساسانية\nكانت طسيفون مع حلول عام 226، في قبضة الإمبراطورية الساسانية التي اتخذتها أيضًا عاصمة لها، وأنهت حكم سلالة البارثيين في إيران. توسعت المدينة وازدهرت على نحو كبير خلال حكمهم، وتحولت إلى عاصمة عُرفت بالعربية باسم «المدائن»، وبالآرامية باسم «ماهوزا». كانت أقدم الأماكن المأهولة في طسيفون تقع على جانبها الشرقي الذي يُطلق عليه في المصادر العربية الإسلامية «المدينة العتيقة»، حيث كان مقر إقامة الساسانيين المعروف بالقصر الأبيض. أما الجانب الجنوبي من المدينة، فعُرف باسم أسبانبار الذي اشتهر بقاعاته الفخمة وثرواته وألعابه وإسطبلاته وحماماته. وكان يقع في هذا الأخير قصر طاق كسرى.\nعُرف الجانب الغربي باسم «فيه-أردشير» (ويعني «مدينة أردشير الطيبة» باللغة البهلولية)، وعرفها اليهود باسم «ماهوزا»، والمسيحيون باسم «كوخه»، والعرب باسم «بهراسير». كانت «فيه-أردشير» مأهولة بعديدٍ من اليهود الأثرياء، وكانت مقر كنيسة البطريرك النسطوري. وإلى الجنوب من «فيه-أردشير» كانت تقع «فالشاباد». وكانت طسيفون تضم عدة مقاطعات أخرى سُميت «هانبو شابور»، و«درزانيدان»، و«وه جونديو خسرو»، و«ناوين آباد»، و«كارداقاد».\nتقدمّ سيفيروس ألكسندر نحو طسيفون في عام 233، ولكن كما أكد هيروديان، مُنيت جيوشه بهزيمة مُذلة أمام أردشير الأول. وفي عام 283، نهب الإمبراطور ماركوس أوريليوس كاروس المدينة من دون مُنازع خلال فترة من الاضطرابات المدنية. زعم بعض المؤرخين أن غاليريوس زحف نحو طسيفون وتمكن من الاستيلاء عليها. لكن ذلك لم يُذكر صراحةً ولا في أي مصدر، ولا يزال موضع جدل بين الباحثين.\nلذا، فمن المرجح أيضًا أن إعادتها للملك الفارسي نرسي بن هرمز مقابل أرمينيا وغرب بلاد ما بين النهرين، لم يحدث قط. كانت المدينة أو المستعمرة اليونانية الواقعة مباشرة عبر النهر، موقعًا لمجالس كنسية تابعة لكنيسة المشرق، وذلك نحو عام 325، ومرة أخرى نحو عام 410.\nبعد فتح أنطاكية في عام 541، بنى كسرى الأول مدينة جديدة قرب طسيفون لسكانها الذين أسرهم. أطلق على هذه المدينة الجديدة اسم «فيه-أنطاكية-كسرو»، أو حرفيًا «أفضل من أنطاكية ومن بناء خسرو». أطلق سكان المنطقة المحليون على المدينة الجديدة اسم روماغان، أي «مدينة الرومان»، بينما أطلق عليها العرب اسم الرومية. إلى جانب «فيه-أنطاكية»، بنى كسرى عددًا من المدن المحصنة. وكتب يوحنا الأفسسي بعد حملة عام 573 أن ما لا يقل عن 292 ألف شخص قد رُحِّلوا من دارا وأفاميا ومدن سريانية أخرى إلى «فيه-أنطاكية». واستشهد يوحنا لاحقًا برسالة تفيد بأن عدد الأسرى الذين رُحِّلوا لم يتجاوز 30 ألفًا. ويُعتقد أن الرقم الأول الذي ذكره لا يُؤخذ بحرفيته.\nدحر بهرام جوبين، أحد أفراد أسرة مهران، في عام 590، الحاكم الساساني الصاعد حديثًا، كسرى الثاني من العراق، واستولى على المنطقة. وبعد عام واحد، استعاد كسرى الثاني ممتلكاته، بمساعدة الإمبراطورية البيزنطية. تراجعت شهرة المدائن على نحوٍ كبير خلال فترة حكمه، بسبب شعبية مقر إقامة كسرى الشتوي الجديد، داستاغرد. وفي عام 627، حاصر الإمبراطور البيزنطي هرقل المدينة، عاصمة الإمبراطورية الساسانية، وتركها بعد أن قَبِل الفرس شروط السلام الخاصة به. وفي عام 628، أصاب وباء مميت طسيفون والمدائن وبقية الجزء الغربي من الإمبراطورية الساسانية، ما أودى بحياة ابن كسرى وخليفته، قباد الثاني.\nظلت طسيفون لفترة وجيزة تحت سيطرة المغتصب المهراني شهربراز في عام 629، وبعد أن اغتيل الأخير على يد أنصار بوران دخت، ابنة كسرى الثاني، واصلت طسيفون انخراطها في القتال المستمر بين فصيلين من الإمبراطورية الساسانية هما، فصيل بهلاف (الفرثي) تحت حكم أسرة إسباهبودان والفصيل البارسيج (الفارسي) تحت قيادة بيروز خسرو.\n\nبعد الفتح الإسلامي\nعندما سقطت العاصمة الفارسية طيسفون الواقعة في مقاطعة خفرفان (المعروفة اليوم بالعراق) على يد المُسلمين خلال الفتح الإسلامي للعراق في عام 637 تحت القيادة العسكرية لسعد بن أبي وقاص خلال خلافة عمر بن الخطاب تم حرق قصورها ومحفوظاتها. وفقًا لمحمد بن جرير الطبري في كتابه تاريخ الطبري، كتب القائد العربي سعد بن أبي وقاص إلى الخليفة عمر بن الخطّاب يسأل فيه عما ينبغي فعله بالكتب في رسالته. وكان رد عمر: إذا كانت الكتب تتناقض مع القرآن، فهي تجديف. من ناحية أخرى، إذا كانت متفقة معها، فليس هناك حاجة لها، لأن القرآن كافٍ لنا. وتم تدمير مكتبة ضخمة وتم حرق عشرات الكتب، وهي نتاج لأجيال من العلماء والباحثين الفرس، وتم أسر ما يقرب من 40,000 من النبلاء

      "content": "Ctésiphon est une ancienne ville parthe, située face à Séleucie du Tigre, sur la rive gauche du Tigre, à 30 km au sud-est de la ville actuelle de Bagdad, en Irak.\nLa ville s'étendait sur 30 km2. Son seul vestige resté visible est la grande arche Taq-e Kisra (en persan : tāq-i kisrā, طاق کسری, « l'iwan de Khosro Ier ») au sud-est de la ville actuelle de Salman Pak (en).\n\nHistoire\nElle est fondée par les Parthes dont les rois en font leur résidence d'hiver : \n« Tout près de Séleucie est un gros bourg, appelé Ctésiphon, dont les rois parthes, par égard pour les Séleuciens, avaient fait leur résidence d'hiver : ils avaient voulu épargner à Séleucie l'ennui de loger à perpétuité ces bandes de Scythes et toute cette soldatesque qu'ils traînaient à leur suite. Mais le développement de l'empire parthe a profité à Ctésiphon, qui, de la condition de simple bourg, s'est élevée aujourd'hui au rang de ville, tant par l'extension de son enceinte dans laquelle toute cette multitude tient à l'aise, que par le nombre des constructions dont ses nouveaux hôtes l'ont ornée, et par l'importance croissante de ses approvisionnements et des diverses industries afférentes aux besoins d'une semblable colonie. L'air est si pur à Ctésiphon que les rois parthes ont conservé l'habitude d'y passer tous leurs hivers ; mais l'été, c'est à Ecbatane ou bien en Hyrcanie qu'ils transportent leur résidence, à cause du prestige qui demeure attaché à ces noms illustres. »\n\nElle fut la capitale de la Perse sous les Sassanides. Elle est conquise par Trajan au printemps 116 pour quelques mois. Elle est mise à sac par l'empereur romain Carus en 283. À partir de 317, avec Papa bar Aggai, la ville devient le siège du catholicos de l'Église de l'Orient. Julien y remporta une bataille décisive en 363, mais il fut tué peu après d'un tir de lance au torse. En 637, Ctésiphon tomba aux mains des musulmans durant la conquête musulmane de la Perse sous le commandement de Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas, à l'époque du calife Omar ibn al-Khattâb.\nSelon certains historiens et écrivains, l'incendie commis par les troupes musulmanes des immenses bibliothèques parthes en araméen, contenant tout le savoir de l'Empire sassanide dura plus de six semaines, d'un feu continu, nuit et jour.\nElle prend alors le nom d'Al-Madâ'in.\nLa ville connut ensuite un rapide déclin à la chute des Omeyyades et devint une ville fantôme. On pense qu'elle servit de référence pour la ville d'Isbanir (fa) dans les contes des Mille et Une Nuits.\nEn 762, les matériaux de Ctésiphon sont utilisés pour la construction de Bagdad.\nCtésiphon est le cadre d'âpres combats à partir de l'automne 1915, lorsque les britanniques marchent sur Bagdad. Les 14 000 hommes du corps anglo-indien du général Charles Townshend se heurtent sur la rive occidentale du Tigre aux troupes turques du général Noureddine Pacha, numériquement supérieures (18 000 hommes). L'offensive est lancée le 22 novembre 1915. Au cours de l'engagement, les Britanniques perdent 4 500 hommes (les Turcs plus de 9 000) et battent rapidement en retraite, avant de se replier sur Al-Kût.\n\nArchitecture\nLa voûte en briques de 30 mètres de haut (iwan), en forme de « chaînette renversée » est le vestige du palais du roi perse Chapour Ier, vainqueur de l'empereur romain Valérien en 260.\nL'aile droite s'est écroulée lors d'une inondation, en 1888 ; sa reconstruction, entreprise par Saddam Hussein, a été interrompue en 1991.

      "content": "## Overview\nCtesiphon is a ruin in Iraq's Baghdad Belts. It was once an ancient Persian capital city, but only a former palace, with the world's largest unreinforced arch, remains standing. The town of Salman Pak is nearby, and is also covered in this article.\n\n## Understand\nCtesiphon was the capital of the Sasanian Empire from 226 AD to its capture by the Arabs in 637 AD. The city has now largely disappeared.\nThe palace of Taq Kasra is the only structure remaining above ground. The palace is considered an architectural landmark with its arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, about 37 meters high 26 meters across and 50 meters long. This made it the largest man-made, free standing vault constructed until modern times. The throne room—presumably under or behind the arch—was more than 30 m (110 ft) high and covered an area 24 m (80 ft) wide by 48 m (160 ft) long. It is unclear exactly when Taq Kasra was built, some historians believe the founder is Shapour I who ruled Persia from 242 to 272 AD while other believe that construction began during the reign of Anushiruwan the Just after a campaign against the Byzantines in 540 AD.\nA number of artifacts belonging to Ctesiphon can be seen at the Museum of Islamic Art in Berlin.\n\n## By car\nThere are roads connecting nearby Baghdad to Salman Pak.\n\n## See\n33.09361144.5808331 Arch of Ctesiphon (Tāq Kasrā). Only visible remaining structure of the ancient city of Ctesiphon. It is the worlds 2nd largest single-span unreinforced brick vault/arch, dated to 3rd-6th Century AD.
