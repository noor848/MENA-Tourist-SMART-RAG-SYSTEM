      "content": "Dur-Kurigalzu (modern `Aqar-Qūf عَقَرْقُوف in Baghdad Governorate, Iraq) was a city in southern Mesopotamia, near the confluence of the Tigris and Diyala rivers, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the center of Baghdad. It was founded by a Kassite king of Babylon, Kurigalzu I (died c. 1375 BC) and was abandoned after the fall of the Kassite dynasty (c. 1155 BC). The city was of such importance that it appeared on toponym lists in the funerary temple of the Egyptian pharaoh, Amenophis III (c. 1351 BC) at Kom el-Hettan\".  The prefix Dur is an Akkadian term meaning \"fortress of\", while the Kassite royal name Kurigalzu is believed to have meant \"shepherd of the Kassites\". The tradition of naming new towns Dur dates back to the Old Babylonian period with an example being  Dūr-Ammī-ditāna. The city contained a ziggurat and temples dedicated to Mesopotamian gods, as well as a royal palace which covered 420,000 square meters.\nThe ziggurat at Aqar Quf, standing to a height of about 52 metres (171 ft), has been a very visible ancient monument for centuries. For camel caravans and modern road traffic, the ziggurat has served as a signal of the near approach to Baghdad. Because of Aqar Quf's easy accessibility and close proximity to the city of Baghdad, it has been one of Iraq's most visited and best-known sites. The ziggurat was often confused with the Tower of Babel by Western visitors to the area from the 17th century onwards.\n\nHistory\nThe town of Dur Kurigalzu was founded by the Kassite King Kurigalzu I in the early 14th century BC and is situated along an east–west-trending limestone ridge between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Until the last century, the adjacent Aqar Quf depression would have been inundated with flood water part of the year. This site had access to fresh water from the Euphrates by means of the Isa Canal, known as the Patti-Enlil Canal in ancient times. The city functioned as the capital of Babylonia during the reign of Kurigalzu, and either as the capital or at least an important city during the period after. It was occupied continuously until the fall of the Kassite Dynasty in the 12th century BC when it was largely abandoned. The temple area, at least, was known to be active in the 7th century BC and in the Neo-Babylonian period. Up until recently (mostly between the 9th and 14th centuries AD), there have been smaller occupations at parts of Aqar Quf, with areas of the site being used for burials and for Arab settlement. It has been suggested that in earlier times the site was named Esâ.\n\nZiggurat\nThe Ziggurat of Dur-Kurigalzu, built in the early 14th century BC by Kurigalzu I, is located in the city's western area and is devoted to the chief Babylonian God Enlil, who Sumerians believed to govern over wind, air, earth, and storm.\nThe ziggurat's base measures 69m x 67m and it was constructed of large, well-tempered liben with many stamped baked bricks incorporated into the structure, bearing the name of Kurigalzu and his dedication of the temple E-U-GAL to Enlil. Facing the front, the Ziggurat can be approached from three main staircases leading up to the first level. Standing upright on the level withholds a terraced compound, built by layers of receding levels. At its core, there are consistent sun-dried square bricks with reed mats placed in every seven layers of brick to help hold the structure altogether. An axial flight of steps was discovered running outwards from the center of the side of the ziggurat towards the temple-complex and was built of solid kiln-baked brick set in bitumen.\n\nArchaeology\nIn Kassite times the area was defined by a wall that enclosed about 425 hectares (1,050 acres). The wall, originally built by Kurigalzu I, was later rebuilt by Kurigalzu II (c. 1332—1308 BC). The site has several defined areas, Mound A (100 meters south of the ziggurat), Tell Ahmar, Tell Abu Shijar, Tell al-Abyadh, and a private housing area. The main elements, ziggurat, palaces, etc. are all within the city wall. The currently known structures of the site consist of nine temples (T1 to T9), with T1 being the ziggurat and associated temple to Enlil, three palaces (P1 to T3), and five housing areas (H1 to H5)\nThe site was visited by Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna in 1616. Agar Quf first appeared on a modern map by Edward Ives in 1773. The site was then described by Claudius James Rich in 1811. Aqar Quf (referred to then as Akerkuf, Agger Koof, or Akar-kuf) was visited and examined in 1837 by Francis Rawdon Chesney. The name of Dur-Kurigalzu was identified by Henry Rawlinson in the mid-19th century.\n\nExcavations were conducted from 1942 through 1945, by Taha Baqir and Seton Lloyd in a joint excavation by the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities and the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. Over 100 cuneiform tablets of the Kassite period were recovered, now in the Iraq Museum. Some were date-able to the reigns of Burna-Buriash II and Kashtiliash IV. They also showed that two of the palaces were named the Palace of the Mountain Sheep and the Palace of the Stag. A kudurru (IM 49991) dated to year five of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash was also found. During the excavation, 5 fragments of a larger-than-life-size statue were discovered. They contain the longest yet found Kassite Sumerian inscriptions.\nA baked brick pavement (T5) around two kilometers northwest of Tell al-Abyadh was found to be covered with hundreds of broken terracotta figurines dedicated to the god Gula. Bricks found in situ were dated to the reign of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash. The excavations included the ziggurat, three temples, and part of the palace of Dur-Kurigalzu II.\n\nIn the early 1960s and from 1968 to 1975 the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities continued to do some excavation around the ziggurat as part of a restoration project under Saddam Hussein The three excavated areas are the mound of Aqar Quf (including the ziggurat and large temple), a public building (approximately 100 metres (330 ft) to the west), and Tell al-Abyadh where a large palace was partially uncovered (about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-west). Several burned cuneiform tables dated to the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina I were found there. As part of a temple restoration a pottery jar was found containing 220 Islamic silver dirhem coins from the Ilkhanid period.\nExcavations continued between 1977 and 1980, led by Suphi Anwar Rashid and Amire al-Khayyat, in the temple area. Paving and wall bricks dedicated to Enlil and Ninlil were found as well as a Kassite double jar burial, an inscribed eyestone for Enlil dedicated by Kurigalzu, and two female figurines in ivory.\nAnother area within Dur-Kurigalzu, Tell Abu Shijar, was excavated by Iraqi archaeologists in 1992, 1993, and 2001 finding mainly late Kassite and lesser Parthian/Sassanian remains. Painted plaster wall fragments, similar to those found at Tell al-Abyadh, were recovered as well as a worn cylinder seal and thirteen cuneiform clay tablets. The tablets were unread (and may be lost) but 3 were noted to have dates of the Kassite king Nazi-Maruttash (1307—1282 BC). The site lies 1 kilometer west of the ziggurat and 500 meters southwest of Tell al-Abyadh being about 6 meters in height with only the central 120-meter by 150-meter mound undisturbed by modern activity.\nIn the late-1960s an Italian team conducted a photogrammatic survey of the ziggurat.\n\nWall paintings at Tell al-Abyadh\nSome of the most significant finds of Kassite period artwork are found in the main palatial complex (P1) and its surrounding complexes (located at Tell al-Abyadh) of Dur-Kurigalzu about 1000 meters northwest of the main ziggurat. The recurring motifs of the artwork found on all four levels of the palatial complex are representational and contain human processional scenes and clusters of fruit; there are also geometric designs that contain parallel bands, chevrons, and rosettes. The processional scenes date to the time of the last Kassite king Marduk-apla-iddina I. The representational motif of human figures is also some of the only surviving instances of human representation in artwork from the Kassite period and gives an indication of the artistic technique utilized at the time. The majority of large, upright wall paintings can be found in the internal rooms of the palace that would have functioned as reception or public rooms. The highest concentration of this wall painting type can be found in Unit H sector on Level II named also 'PaintedPalace', dating to the reign of Kaštiliaš IV.\nAnother wall painting type is also found along recesses of the courtyards and between rooms and contains the same motifs of floral and geometric designs and processional scenes that Yoko Tomabechi states function to 'brighten the doorways and the inner rooms'. The colours utilised in these paintings are 'red, cobalt-blue, dark-blue, yellow, white and black'. Much of the palatial complex and its artwork inside remain unexcavated and need further exploration. In January 2025 the site of Aqar Quf has been included in the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Convention.\n\nTemples\nAt the base of the ziggurat steps, is a pavement that leads to one of the four excavated temples, E-U-GAL. This would also continue to lead into a court and several smaller rooms adjoining it. The other three temples are E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL, E-SAG-DINGIR-RI-E-NE, and E-SAG-DINGIR-E-NE. King Kurigalzu appears to have built all these temples under great patronage. The entire complex mostly has liben walls that are thickly covered with plaster and may bear traces of fire, which are thought to reflect attempts in destroying the site in the past.\n\nE-U-GAL\nE-U-GAL, which is likely to mean \"The House of the Great Lord,\" is believed to be the most important temple of Dur Kurigalzu. This name could also refer to the entire temple complex or the entire site as the text was engraved into bricks in all three temples and in the ziggurat.\n\nE-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL\nThe name of the temple is a combination of \"The House of the Lady\" and words meaning \"high\", \"firm\", or \"great\". Inside this temple is a small staircase that leads up to an altar, subsidiary courts, and a room that appears to be the kitchen where a raised rectangular compartment was excavated and assumed to be an oven.\n\nTower\nBetween E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL and E-U-GAL is a massive ruin, excavated to be 17 meters tall, that could be the foundation of a tower that was weathered away by floods. This structure was also made with liben and faced with baked bricks.\n\nCurrent status\nFor 16 seasons in the 1960s and 1970s the Iraqi government did conservation and restoration work at the site. Unfortunately the modern restoration work resulted in significant damage to the original construction it overlaid as it did at Babylon. Aqar Quf is currently suffering environmental damage and urban encroachment. Natural factors like rain and standing groundwater have contributed to the erosion of the ziggurat and damage to the ruins, especially along the southwest side. As a result of this damage, the ziggurat is in danger of further deterioration as well as collapse if preventive measures are not taken. The suburbs and industrial areas of Baghdad also continue developing near the site. Currently, there is an encroachment of modern construction along some stretches of the enclosure wall. There is also agricultural encroachment along the enclosure wall, especially on the southwest side. Iraqi Army maneuvers, involving trenches, did some damage to the site in the 1980s.\nThe ziggurat suffered damage as a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq when the site was abandoned and looted during the security breakdown and chaos that followed the U.S. military's overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Little is left of the modern administration building, museum, event stage, and restaurant that once served the picnickers and students who visited the site before the war. Local government officials and the U.S. military charged with security in the area have been working to create a renovation plan. Since mid-2008, local officials have drafted plans to rebuild the historic site, yet to be implemented.\nAn Iraqi-Italian Archaeological Expedition by the University of Bologna and the SBAH, under the direction of prof. Nicolò Marchetti, has been working at the site of Aqar Quf since the Fall of 2022. The systematic survey of the site has been completed and, since the Fall of 2024, systematic excavations have also begun in the palace and temple areas. A new conservation project \"ArTourBagh\" funded by AICS and coordinated by Marchetti started in the Spring of 2025 with the aim of protecting and enhancing the mudbrick remains at the site, while promoting the touristic and social development in the area.\n\nTell Basmaya\nThe site of Tell Basmaya lies about seven kilometers southeast of modern Baghdad at the Tigris-Diyala river junction and just to the northeast of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu. It covers an area of about 4 hectares and consists of eight mounds (ranging in height from 1 to 4.5 meters). All of the mounds have now been destroyed by modern development. It was first identified in a 1957-1958 regional survey by Robert Adams (site #562). It was worked for two seasons from 2013 to 2014 by the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, led by Taha K. Abod, in a program of rescue archaeology before the area was developed. Excavation occurred at four (5, 6, 7, 8) of the mounds only two of which (6 and 7) showed signs of occupation. On mound seven (0.96 hectares in area, 4 meters in height) eight sizable (five with 5 rooms, three with 13 rooms, one with 16 rooms) buildings were excavated. Ten fragmentary cuneiform tablets were found in those buildings with two tablets bearing year names (14th and 17th) of Kassite ruler Kadashman-Turgu (c. 1281–1264 BC) along with five cylinder seals and one sealing. One seal, of fossilized coral, contains the inscription \"Marduk, have mercy on him\". Small finds included metal daggers and chisels and a number of faience objects, including a face mask and three chariot fittings. Forty-four intramural and extramural graves were found including a brick tomb and a vaulted tomb. Some late Sassanian and early Arabic period remains were found including many Aramaic incantation bowls.\n\nGallery\nThe following images represent the status of Aqar-Quf and its architectural remains as of December 29, 2021.\n\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\nKassite deities\nKudurru\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nal-BakRī, m.d., \"The discovery of Julairid coins at ‘Aqar-qūf\", Al-Maskūkat 3, pp. 77-80, 1972 (in arabic)\nAl-Hadithi, A., \"Archaeological excavations at Tell Abu Shijar ('Aqar Qūf).

      "content": "زقورة عقرقوف وهي زقورة تَقع في العراق، قرب العاصمة بغداد، وكانت معلم إحدى المُدن في جنوب بلاد وادي الرافدين بالقرب من التقاء نهري دِجلة وديالى على بعد 30 كيلو متر (19 ميل) من غرب مركز بغداد، ولقد تأسست من قبل ملك الكيشين كوريغالزو الأول في القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد، وكانت تُعتبر عاصمة الكيشين وأنتهت أهميتها بعد سقوط سلالة الكيشين، وتحتوي الزقورة على المعابد المكرسة لآلهة السومريين فضلاً عن القَصر الملكي، وليس من السهل الحفاظ عليها من اثار التقادم الزمني والاندثار، ويبلغ أرتفاع الزقورة نحو 170 قدم (52 م).\n\nالتاريخ\nيعود تاريخ تأسيس الزقورة إلى ملك الكيشين كوريغالزو الأول في أواخر القرن الخامس عشر وأوائل القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد، وتَقع الزقورة على طول تلال كلسة بين الشرق والغرب ونهر دجلة والفرات، وفي القرن الماضي غمرت مياه الفيضان زقورة عقرقوف وسبب الفيضان تحطيم بعض الأجزاء من الزقورة، ولعل مياه الفيضان قد كانت تفيد المدينة سابقا للدفاع والحماية، كما كانت تسقى من نهر عيسى المشهور، الذي كان يسمى في العهود البابلية بـ (قنال انليل)، وكانت الزقورة عاصمة للبلاد في عهد كوريكالزو في العصور القديمة، وبعد سقوط سلالة الكيشين فقدت مكانتها وأحتلت في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد وتركت وتخلى عنها إلى حد كبير. وأستمر الأستيطان والسكن في مدينة عقرقوف بعد سقوط الدولة الكيشية على يد العيلاميين، حيث أستوطنها الأراميين في عصر دولة بابل الحديثة ويعتقد أنهم هم من أطلقو تسمية عقرقوف، وأعادوا أعمار المدينة من جديد بعض تعرضها إلى هجمات الأشوريين المتكررة، وأستمر الأستيطان فيها حتى العصر العربي الإسلامي حيث أستوطنها المسلمين من القرن الثالث وحتى القرن الثامن عشر وما زال الأستيطان موجوداً إلى حد الآن حيث أن منطقة أبو غريب قريبة على موقع زقورة وتقطن فيها الآن عشائر عربية عراقية.\n\nفي زمن الكيشين كان يحيط الزقورة سور ضخم جداً يقدر بحوالي 225 هكتار (560 فداناً)،  والجوانب خلف السور من الضاحية الشرقية للزقورة كان يتواجد فيها هناك بحيرة من الماء، ويتواجد العديد من التلال حول الزقورة، وتعتبر زقورة عقرقوف من المباني التراثية والتاريخية في المنطقة، والزقورة كانت مُكرسة للإلهة الرئيسية وهم «أنليل» و«نينليل» و«نينورتا»، ولقد تأسست المعابد في الجنوب الشرقي من الزقورة وتَبين من خلال التنقيبات التي أجراها الباحثون الأثريون في بداية عقد الأربعينيات من القرن العشرين أن الملك كوريكالزو الثالث هو مؤسس هذهِ المعابد والتي تتكون من ساحات كبيرة يحيط بها عدد كبير من الحجرات والأورقة والممرات، وأعتماداً على الإدلة الأثرية المكتشفة في هذا الموقع تبين أن هذه المعابد استعملت من قبل الأدوار التي خلفت (الدور الكيشي) وهو العهد الأشوري والعهد البابلي الحديث (1000 ــ 500 ق.م)، ولقد شيد الملوك الكيشيين قصور المدينة المكتشفة في تل أبيض شمال غرب الزقورة وتدل الكتابات المسمارية التي عثر عليها في قصور المدينة بأسم قصور مدينة كويكالزو وتعرض معالم معمارية من مرافق قصور الملوك المهمة وهي ثلاثة أقببة متوازية إلى جانبي كل منها عدد من المخازن المعقودة بهيئة جيوب نصف دائرية، وقاعدة الزقورة مُربعة الشكل تقريباً أبعادها (69 × 67) وتتجه زواياها إلى الجهات الأربع وتميل أوجهها الأربعة عن العامود إلى الداخل بحوالي 9 سم لكل متر من الأرتفاع، وأوجه القاعدة مُغلقة من الخارج بغلاف من الآجر تزينه وتحليه هندسة معمارية على شكل نظام الطلعات والدخلات في أوجهها الأربعة، وتوجد ثلاث سلالم سلم وسطي وسلمان جانبيان يتصلان بها وتؤدي إلى سطح القاعدة المُربعة التي شيدتها المديرية العامة للآثار العراقية.\n\nالزقورة\nبُنيت زقورة عقرقوف في القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد من قبل ملك الكيشين كوريغالزو الأول، وتحتوي الزقورة على مجموعة طبقات وتبدو الطبقات من البوري (حصير القصب) موضوعة في البناء بين كل 8 أو 9 مسافات من اللبن تتخللها ثقوب مربعة كبيرة تنفذ داخل الزقورة والهدف منها التخلص من الرطوبة والمياه التي تصيب الزقورة بين آونة وأخرى.\nوكانت الزقورة مركزاً تجارياً لعدة قرون، حيث كانت تمر بها قوافل الأبل والتجارة على الطرق الحديثة، ويعتبر موقع الزقورة أحد المواقع المفضلة للنزهة من قبل العوائل البغدادية خصوصا في العطل ويوم الجمعة، وقد بُني مبنى مَتحف صغير بقربها في عام 1960 وأنشئ لتقديم الخدمات لزوار الموقع وهو الآن مُهمل.\nبسبب قرب موقع زقورة عقرقوف إلى العاصمة بغداد، فقد مكنها ذلك من أن تصبح من الأماكن والمواقع العراقية التراثية الأكثر شهرة وزيارة.\n\nالدراسة والبحث\nتم أعطاء وَصف للموقع لأول مرة من قبل كلوديس جيمس ريش في عام 1811، ولقد تم زيارة زقورة عقرقوف في عام 1837 من قبل فرانسيس راودون تشيسيني، وتعرف على أسم زقورة عقرقوف التي كتب عنها هنري رولينسون في منتصف القرن التاسع عشر ميلادي.\n\nأجريت عمليات حَفر وتنقيب في الأعوام 1942-1945 من قبل الباحث العراقي طه باقر مع الباحث الإنكليزي سيتون لويد وكان العمل مُشترك بين المديرية العامة للآثار العراقية والمدرسة البريطانية للآثار في العراق. وكُشف عن أكثر من 100 لوح مكتوب بالخط المسماري في فترة عهد الكيشين، والألواح موجودة حاليا في قاعات المتحف الوطني العراقي.\nوشملت الحفريات والتنقيب، مبنى الزقورة والمعابد الثلاث وجزء من قصر زقورة عقرقوف الثانية، وواصلت المديرية العامة للآثار العراقية القيام ببعض أعمال الحفر حول مبنى الزقورة كجزء من مشروع الترميم والصيانة في عهد الرئيس العراقي السابق صدام حسين، وفي عام 1970 أعيد بناءها في المرحلة الدنيا من الهيكل، المناطق الثلاثة المجاورة إلى زقورة عقرقوف (تتضمن الزقورة والمعابد) والمباني العامة (حوالي 100 متر إلى الجنوب الغربي)، والتل الأبيض كان قصر كبير جداً، وكانت الزقورة مكونة من طبقات من الحصير القصب التي كانت تمسك هيكل البناء لكي لا يَقع، وعُثر على العديد من الأعمال الرئيسية المعروفة حالياً من فترة عهد الكيشين داخل قصر تل الآبيض وموجود هناك في عقرقوف، ولقد تم حَفر وأستكشاف تل أبو شجر من قبل علماء الآثار العراقية ونشرت النتائج.\n\nالوضع الحالي\nتعاني زقورة عقرقوف حالياً من الأضرار البيئية والزحف العمراني أو التوسع العمراني وقد أدت عوامل طبيعية مثل الأمطار والمياة الجوفية إلى تآكل الزقورة ولحوق الآضرار بها، وخصوصاً على طول الجانب الجنوبي الغربي، ونتيجة لهذا الضرر فأن الزقورة في خطر ومزيد من التدهور وكذلك الأنهيار ما لم يَتخد أجراءات وتدابير وقائية، وتستمر الضواحي والمناطق الصناعية في بغداد على التطوير والتوسع بالقرب من الموقع، وايضاً يوجد التوسع الزراعي على الموقع، وفي عام 1980 كان يوجد مناورات إلى الجيش العراقي مما سُبب في تضرر الزقورة.\nتضررت الزقورة من الغزو الأمريكي للعراق وتعرضت للنهب والهمل خلال أنهيار الأمن وانعيام الفوضى التي أعقبت الإطاحة بالنظام العراقي الذي كان يرأسهُ صدام حسين، وبقي القليل من مبنى حديث الإدارة والمتحف والمطعم الذي خدم المتنزهين والطلاب الذين زارو الموقع قبل الحرب، في منتصف عام 2008 صاغ مسؤولون محليون خطط لإعادة بناء الموقع التاريخي، وفي عام 2013 قامت المديرية العامة للآثار العراقية بعملية صيانة زقورة عقرقوف وكانت عملية التأهيل تأتي ضمن فعاليات مشروع بغداد عاصمة الثقافة العربية في عام 2013.\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر أيضًا\nزقورة أور\n\nالمصادر\nمراجع عربية\n\nمراجع إنكليزية\n\n\n== قراءة مُتعمقة ==",

      "content": "Dûr-Kurigalzu était une ville de la Mésopotamie antique, dont les ruines se trouvent sur le site actuel d'‘Aqar Qūf (en arabe : عقرقوف), localisé à 30 km à l’ouest de Bagdad, fondée par un roi de la dynastie kassite de Babylone nommé Kurigalzu (probablement le premier des deux ayant porté ce nom), vers 1400 av. J.-C.\nLe site s'étend sur environ 225 hectares protégés par une enceinte, comprenant plusieurs tells, sur une terrasse calcaire bordant l'Euphrate. Dans l'Antiquité elle était également bordée par un canal, appelé Patti-Enlil, qui rejoignait à l'est la ville de Sippar. Le tell principal, ‘Aqar Qūf, est le centre religieux, tandis que les deux autres tells majeur sont le tell al-Abyad, 1 kilomètre à l'ouest du précédent, comprenant un palais royal, ainsi que le tell A, situé entre les deux à une centaine de mètres du premier.\nLes tells principaux ont été fouillés entre 1942 et 1945 par une équipe irakienne et britannique dirigée par Taha Baqir et Seton Lloyd. Les résultats des fouilles n'ont été publiés que dans des rapports préliminaires et n'ont pas fait l'objet de publications définitives. Une grande partie du matériel qui y a été exhumé, conservé au Musée de Bagdad après les fouilles, reste également non publié. Comme souvent, seuls les quartiers officiels ont fait l'objet de fouilles, et l'urbanisme de cette vaste cité nouvelle n'est pas connu.\n\nHistorique\nComme son nom l'indique, Dūr-Kurigalzu/« Fort Kurigalzu » a été fondée par un roi nommé Kurigalzu. Deux souverains de la dynastie kassite ayant porté ce nom, un doute a subsisté sur l'identité du fondateur. Mais il est désormais admis qu'il s'agit du premier, qui a régné autour de 1400 av. J.-C. jusqu'aux environs de 1375 av. J.-C., et fut un des plus prolifiques bâtisseurs de sa dynastie, actif dans la plupart des grandes villes de Babylonie, car la ville est mentionnée dans un texte daté du règne de Burna-Buriash II, le père du second Kurigalzu.\nLe site d'Aqar Quf a été habité avant le règne de Kurigalzu Ier, au moins au XVe siècle av. J.-C., l'agglomération s'appelant alors Parsâ (idéogrammes KUR.TIKI). Les constructions entreprises par Kurigalzu l'inscrivent dans la continuité des fondations royales mésopotamiennes plus anciennes, mais le site est remarquable par son étendue par rapport aux créations urbaines antérieures. Comme souvent on ne sait pas exactement pourquoi cette décision a été prise. En tout état de cause, cela n'a pas empêché Babylone de rester la principale ville du royaume, même si Dur-Kurigalzu a sans doute été une résidence royale importante pour les rois kassites.\nLa ville semble avoir été largement désertée après la chute de la dynastie au milieu du XIIe siècle av. J.-C., et n'aura donc connu qu'une occupation de deux siècles et demi environ. Elle est néanmoins encore mentionnée par la suite, notamment parmi les prises du roi assyrien Teglath-Phalasar Ier (1116-1077), ou les conquêtes des Araméens sous le roi babylonien Adad-apla-iddina (vers 1069-1048 av. J-C), et apparaît encore dans la première moitié du Ier millénaire av. J.-C. sous le nom abrégé Dur-Galzu.\n\nLa ziggurat et les temples\nLe complexe religieux de Dur-Kurigalzu est dédié au grand dieu Enlil. Il est dominé par une ziggurat (nom cérémoniel en sumérien é-gi-rin, « Demeure pure ») très ruinée mais dont le cœur a subsisté. Sa base, quasiment carrée, mesurait 69 mètres sur 67,60, et devait s'élever jusqu'à 70 mètres de haut ; elles font encore 57 mètres de haut de nos jours, état de conservation remarquable pour une ziggurat. Elle comprenait un escalier principal, central, et deux escaliers latéraux, suivant la configuration courante pour les ziggurats du Sud de la Mésopotamie. Sa première terrasse, encore bien conservée au moment des fouilles et restaurée à l'issue de celles-ci, s'élève à 33 mètres de hauteur. Elle est construite en briques d'argiles, renforcées par différents dispositifs, notamment un ancrage de cordes de roseaux tressées courant sur toute sa longueur.\nLe temple principal du site, mal conservé, comprenait au moins trois cours principales entourées de pièces. Sa partie centrale était le sanctuaire d'Enlil (é-u-gal, « Demeure du Grand Seigneur ») tandis que celle au nord-est était dédiée à son épouse Ninlil (é-gašan-an-ta-gal, « Demeure de la Dame élevée ») et le secteur sud-ouest à leur fils Ninurta (é-sag-dingir-re-e-ne, « Demeure principale des Dieux »). Cet ensemble, construit dans les formes traditionnelles de la Mésopotamie, est remarquable par l’ampleur de la conception.\n\nLe palais royal\nLe palais (é-gal-ki-šár-ra, « Palais de la Totalité (de l'Univers) »), incomplètement dégagé, était tout aussi massif, mais introduit des formes plus nouvelles. Les différents corps de bâtiment, organisés traditionnellement autour d’un grand espace central, couvrent à peu près 420 000 m2 : aucun palais n’avait atteint une telle ampleur. La voûte semble avoir été utilisée systématiquement pour couvrir les salles du premier niveau (première utilisation sur des portées atteignant 7 m). L'unité principale, appelée unité A, comprenait trois groupes de pièces organisés autour de cours, ainsi qu'une vaste cour carrée. L’ampleur de l’ouvrage, le grand nombre d’unités, l’existence d’un portique en maçonnerie, d'une trésor constitué d'un corridor bordé par des chambres voûtées, les longues processions de personnages peints sur les murs forment un ensemble tout à fait nouveau qui ne semble pas avoir eu de postérité.\nSuivant une interprétation proposée par J.-W. Meyer, l'édifice comprenait en tout huit unités distinctes, chacune dédiée à une tribu kassite. L'édifice semblerait avoir été employé notamment lors de cérémonies d'intronisation des souverains kassites, qui venaient y recevoir l'hommage des principaux dignitaires de leur peuple après avoir été investis rois de Babylone dans la capitale traditionnelle. Cela renverrait aux processions peintes, représentant sans doute les dignitaires.\nQuelques tablettes administratives ont été dégagées dans l'édifice (une quarantaine a été publiée), qui a par ailleurs livré plusieurs trouvailles artistiques, notamment des sculptures en terre cuite et en calcaire, des fragments d'objets en matières vitreuses, des bijoux en or.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\nA.

      "summary": "Dûr-Kurigalzu était une ville de la Mésopotamie antique, dont les ruines se trouvent sur le site actuel d'‘Aqar Qūf (en arabe : عقرقوف), localisé à 30 km à l’ouest de Bagdad, fondée par un roi de la dynastie kassite de Babylone nommé Kurigalzu (probablement le premier des deux ayant porté ce nom), vers 1400 av. J.-C.\nLe site s'étend sur environ 225 hectares protégés par une enceinte, comprenant plusieurs tells, sur une terrasse calcaire bordant l'Euphrate. Dans l'Antiquité elle était également bordée par un canal, appelé Patti-Enlil, qui rejoignait à l'est la ville de Sippar. Le tell principal, ‘Aqar Qūf, est le centre religieux, tandis que les deux autres tells majeur sont le tell al-Abyad, 1 kilomètre à l'ouest du précédent, comprenant un palais royal, ainsi que le tell A, situé entre les deux à une centaine de mètres du premier.\nLes tells principaux ont été fouillés entre 1942 et 1945 par une équipe irakienne et britannique dirigée par Taha Baqir et Seton Lloyd. Les résultats des fouilles n'ont été publiés que dans des rapports préliminaires et n'ont pas fait l'objet de publications définitives. Une grande partie du matériel qui y a été exhumé, conservé au Musée de Bagdad après les fouilles, reste également non publié. Comme souvent, seuls les quartiers officiels ont fait l'objet de fouilles, et l'urbanisme de cette vaste cité nouvelle n'est pas connu.",
