      "content": "Baghdad is the capital and largest city in Iraq. It is located on the banks of the Tigris in central Iraq. The city has an estimated population of 8 million. It ranks among the most populous and largest cities in the Middle East and the Arab world and constitutes 22% of the country's population. Baghdad is a primary financial and commercial center in the region.\nFounded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into an intellectual and cultural center. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the \"Center of Learning\". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an, as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues, shift in power and multiple successive empires. Later, Baghdad served as the administrative center of Ottoman Iraq, exercising authority over the provinces of Basra, Mosul, and Shahrizor.\nDuring the First World War, Baghdad was made the capital of Mandatory Iraq. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. During the Ba'ath Party rule, the city experienced a period of relative prosperity and growth. However, it faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During the insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare. Since the end of the war, numerous reconstruction projects have been underway to induce stability.\nIraq's largest city, Baghdad is the seat of government. It generates 40% of the economy of Iraq. A major center of Islamic history, Baghdad is home to numerous historic mosques, as well as churches, mandis and synagogues, highlighting the city's historical diversity. Religious sites such as Masjid al-Kadhimayn, Buratha Mosque, the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Abu Hanifa Mosque are visited by millions of people annually. It was once home to a large Jewish community and was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India. Baghdad is a regional cultural hub. The city is well known for its coffeehouses.\n\nName\nThe name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed. The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Baghdad was occupied by various peoples long before the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in 637 CE, and several ancient empires had capitals located in the surrounding area.\nArab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in Middle Persian. They suggested various meanings, the most common of which was \"bestowed by God\". Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology, which views the word as a Persian compound of bagh () \"god\" and dād () \"given\". In Old Persian the first element can be traced to boghu and is related to Indo-Iranian bhag and Slavic bog \"god.\" A similar term in Middle Persian is the name Mithradāt (Mehrdad in New Persian), known in English by its borrowed Hellenistic form Mithridates, meaning \"Given by Mithra\" (dāt is the more archaic form of dād, related to Sanskrit dāt, Latin dat and English donor), ultimately borrowed from Persian Mehrdad. There are a number of other locations whose names are compounds of the Middle Persian word bagh, including Baghlan and Bagram in Afghanistan, Baghshan in Iran itself, and Baghdati in Georgia, which likely share the same etymological Iranic origins.\nOther authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name Bagdadu or Hudadu that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both bag and hu), and the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic name of a place called Baghdatha (בגדתא). Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations.\nAnother highly recommended view is that Baghdad is a reference to Bagh and Dad as in Dadan, Dedan, and Dad as in Hadad, Adad. Another view suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of \"Baghdad\" is derived from \"Akkad\", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad (𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠) is pronounced \"a-ga-dèKI\" (\"Agade\") and its resemblance to \"Baghdad\" is compelling. It is argued that, throughout all the various spellings of the city's name, whether Baghdad [بغداد], Baghdadh [بغداذ], Baghdan [بغدان], Maghdad [مغداد], Maghdadh [مغداذ], or Maghdan [مغدان], the only phonetically definite segment of the name appears to be Aghda [ىَغْدَا], which could be equated with the pronunciation of the name Agade.\nWhen the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name \"City of peace\" (Arabic: مدینة السلام, romanized: Madīnat as-Salām), which now refers to the Round City of Baghdad proper. By the 11th century, Baghdad became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.\nChristophe Wall-Romana has suggested that al-Mansur's choice to found his \"new city\" at Baghdad because of its strategic location was the same criteria which influenced Sargon's choice to found the original city of Akkad in the exact same location.\n\nHistory\nFoundation\nAfter the fall of the Umayyads, the victorious Abbasids sought a new capital. On 30 July 762, the Caliph Al-Mansur commissioned Baghdad's construction, guided by the Iranian Barmakids. He believed Baghdad was ideal for ruling the Islamic Empire. Historian al-Tabari recorded a prophecy from Christian monks about a leader named Miklas building a great city in the area, and Al-Mansur, who was once called Miklas, saw this as a good omen. He expressed deep affection for the site, declaring it would be the home of his dynasty.\nThe two designers who were hired by Al-Mansur to plan the city's design were Naubakht, a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a Jew from Khorasan, Iran. They determined the city's auspicious founding date under the sign of Leo the lion, symbolizing strength and expansion.\nBaghdad's strategic location along the Tigris and its abundant water supply contributed to its rapid growth. It was divided into three judicial districts: Round City (Madinat al-Mansur), al-Karkh (al-Sharqiyya), and Askar al-Mahdi. To prevent disturbances, Al-Mansur moved markets to al-Karkh. Over time, Baghdad became a hub for merchants and craftsmen. Officials called \"Muhtasib\" monitored trade to prevent fraud.\nBaghdad surpassed Ctesiphon, the former Sassanid capital, located 30 km southeast. The ruins of Ctesiphon remain in Salman Pak, where Salman the Persian is believed to be buried. Ctesiphon itself had replaced Seleucia, which had earlier succeeded Babylon. According to the traveler Ibn Battuta, Baghdad was one of the largest cities, not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly Hanbalis. Most residents were Hanbali Muslims. The city housed Abu Hanifa's grave, marked by a mosque and cell. Its ruler, Abu Said Bahadur Khan, was a Tatar who had embraced Islam.\nBaghdad was designed to symbolize Paradise as described in the Qur'an. It took four years (764–768) to build, with over 100,000 workers involved. Al-Mansur recruited engineers and artisans worldwide. Astrologers Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah advised starting construction under Leo, associated with fire, productivity, and expansion. Bricks for the city were 18 inches square, and Abu Hanifah supervised their production. A canal supplied water for drinking and construction. Marble was used extensively, including steps leading to the river.\nThe city's layout consisted of two large semicircles, with a 2 km-wide circular core known as the \"Round City.\" It had parks, gardens, villas, and promenades. Unlike European cities of the time, Baghdad had a sanitation system, fountains, and public baths, with thousands of hammams enhancing hygiene. The mosque and guard headquarters stood at the center, though some central space's function remains unknown. Baghdad's circular design reflected ancient Near Eastern urban planning, similar to the Sasanian city of Gur and older Mesopotamian cities like Mari. While Tell Chuera and Tell al-Rawda also provide examples of this type of urban planning existing in Bronze Age Syria. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient Greek and Roman urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.\nBaghdad was lively, with attractions like cabarets, chess halls, live plays, concerts, and acrobatics. Storytelling flourished, with professional storytellers (al-Qaskhun) captivating crowds, inspiring the tales of Arabian Nights. The city had four walls named after major destinations—Kufa, Basra, Khurasan, and Syria; their gates pointed in on these destinations. The gates were 2.4 km apart, with massive iron doors requiring several men to operate. The walls, up to 44 meters thick and 30 meters high, were reinforced with a second wall, towers, and a moat for added defense. On street corners, storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights. The Golden Gate Palace, home of the caliph, stood at Baghdad's center with a grand 48-meter green dome. Only the caliph could approach its esplanade on horseback. Nearby were officer residences and a guardhouse. After Caliph Al-Amin's death in 813, the palace ceased to be the caliph's residence.\n\nCenter of learning (8th–9th centuries)\nWithin a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of learning and commerce. The city flourished into an unrivaled intellectual center of science, medicine, philosophy, and education, especially with the Abbasid translation movement began under the second caliph Al-Mansur and thrived under the seventh caliph Al-Ma'mun. Baytul-Hikmah or the \"House of Wisdom\" was among the most well known academies, and had the largest selection of books in the world by the middle of the 9th century. Notable scholars based in Baghdad during this time include translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq, mathematician al-Khwarizmi, and philosopher Al-Kindi.\n\nAlthough Arabic was used as the language of science, the scholarship involved not only Arabs, but also Persians, Syriacs, Nestorians, Jews, Arab Christians, and people from other ethnic and religious groups native to the region. These are considered among the fundamental elements that contributed to the flourishing of scholarship in the Medieval Islamic world. Baghdad was also a significant center of Islamic religious learning, with Al-Jahiz contributing to the formation of Mu'tazili theology, as well as Al-Tabari culminating in the scholarship on the Quranic exegesis. Baghdad is likely to have been the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it tied with Córdoba. Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak. Many of the One Thousand and One Nights tales, widely known as the Arabian Nights, are set in Baghdad during this period. It would surpass even Constantinople in prosperity and size.\nAmong the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.\n\nFour great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al-Ma'mun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. This second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society. The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nezamiyeh was founded by the Persian Nizam al-Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyya Madrasa, which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al-Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.\n\nStagnation and invasions (10th–16th centuries)\nBy the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2 million and 2 million. Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate, including relocations of the capital to Samarra (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids (945–1055) and Seljuk Turks (1055–1135). The Seljuks were a clan of the Oghuz Turks from Central Asia that converted to the Sunni branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the Ghaznavids, taking over their land and in 1055, Tughril Beg, the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the Buyid dynasty of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as Sultans in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.\n\nBaghdad was captured in 1394, 1534, 1623 and 1638. The city has been sieged in 812, 865, 946, 1157, 1258 and in 1393 and 1401, by Tamerlane. In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the Fatimids under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the Ismailis along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh. Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da'i, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Mawṣil, Wāsit and Kufa. Soon after, by December 1058, a Shi'i adhān (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph. Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.\n\nOn 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the Mongols led by Hulegu, a grandson of Genghis Khan (Chingiz Khan), during the siege of Baghdad. Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph Al-Musta'sim, and destroyed large sections of the city. The canals and dykes forming the city's irrigation system were also destroyed. During this time, in Baghdad, Christians and Shia were tolerated, while Sunnis were treated as enemies. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate. It has been argued that this marked an end to the Islamic Golden Age and served a blow from which Islamic civilization never fully recovered.\nAt this point, Baghdad was ruled by the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, ruling from Iran. In August 1393, Baghdad was occupied by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror Timur (\"Tamerlane\"), by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan Ahmad Jalayir fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan Barquq protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the Sarbadar prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern Baghdad, but he was driven out when Ahmad Jalayir returned.\n\nIn 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by Timur, a Central Asian Turko-Mongol figure. When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads. Baghdad became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol Jalayirid (1400–1411), Turkic Kara Koyunlu (1411–1469), Turkic Ak Koyunlu (1469–1508), and the Iranian Safavid (1508–1534) dynasties.\n\nOttoman and Mamluks (16th–19th centuries)\nThe Safavids took control of the city in 1509 under the leadership of Shah Ismail I. It remained under Safavid rule until the Ottomans seized it in 1535, but the Safavids regained control in 1624. A massacre occurred when the Shah's army entered the city. It remained under Safavid rule until 1639 when Sultan Murad IV recaptured it in 1638.\nIn 1534, Baghdad was captured by the Ottoman Empire, becoming the administrative capital of Ottoman Iraq. Under the Ottomans, Baghdad continued into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. Between 1623 and 1638, it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague and cholera, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out. The city became part of an eyalet and then a vilayet.\nFor a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century, under Mamluk government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by Ali Rıza Pasha in 1831. From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by Mehmed Namık Pasha. The Nuttall Encyclopedia reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000.\nThe city's municipality was established in 1868, and Ibrahim al-Daftari was appointed its first mayor. The year 1869 is of great importance in the history of Baghdad in the Ottoman era, as it was the beginning of what can be considered a distinct era of the Ottoman eras, the foundations of which were laid by Governor Midhat Pasha, who implemented a number of reform systems and laws that the state legislated during the era of reforms and reconstruction, which was called the Tanzimat era. The overall importance of Baghdad to the Ottomans was that they made the headquarters of the Sixth Corps of the Ottoman Army in the city.\nBy the 19th century, Baghdad emerged as a leading center for Jewish learning. The city had Jewish population of over 6,000 and had numerous yeshivas. The Jewish population has grown so rapidly that by 1884, there were 30,000 Jews in Baghdad and by 1900, around 50,000, comprising over a quarter of the city's total population. Large-scale Jewish immigration from Kurdistan to Baghdad continued throughout this period. By the mid-19th century, the religious infrastructure of Baghdad grew to include a large yeshiva which trained up to sixty rabbis at time. Religious scholarship flourished in Baghdad, which produced great rabbis, such as Joseph Hayyim ben Eliahu Mazal-Tov, known as the Ben Ish Chai (1834–1909) or Rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813–1889). During this time, Baghdadi Jews established a successful trade diaspora in China, India and Singapore.\n\nModern era\nBaghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1918, when they were captured by the British during World War I. In 1920, a revolt erupted in Baghdad against new British policies. It began in summer with mass demonstrations by Iraqis, including protests by embittered officers from the old Ottoman Army. The revolt gained momentum and spread to the middle and lower Euphrates. The British authorities retaliated by air bombing across Baghdad, which killed thousands of residents. In 1921, under the Mandate of Mesopotamia, Baghdad became the capital of the British-protected monarchy. Baghdad was made capital of the independent kingdom of Iraq in 1932.\nSeveral architectural and planning projects were commissioned to reinforce this administration. During this period, the substantial Jewish community (probably exceeding 100,000 people) comprised between a quarter and a third of the city's population. The National Museum of Iraq and the University of Baghdad were built by King Faisal, who laid foundation for the modern Iraqi state. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. A development plan came in 1957, visioned by Frank Lloyd Wright. The plan proposed to build a cultural hub on an island on the river, with an opera house, museums, a university, shopping malls, and a 300-foot statue of the fifth Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid.\nOn 1 April 1941, members of the \"Golden Square\" led by former minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani staged a coup in Baghdad and installed a pro-German and pro-Italian government to replace the pro-British government of Regent Abd al-Ilah. The British forces intervened in the resulting Anglo-Iraqi War. Fearing the advancement, Gaylani and his government had fled, and the mayor of Baghdad surrendered to the British and Commonwealth forces. On 1–2 June, during the ensuing power vacuum, Jewish residents were attacked following rumors they had aided the British. In what became known as the Farhud, over 180 Jews were killed and 1,000 injured, 900 Jewish homes were destroyed, and hundreds of Jewish properties were ransacked. Many Jewish girls were raped and children maimed in front of their families. Between 300 and 400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence. Between 1950 and 1951, Jews were targeted in series of bombings. According to Avi Shlaim, Israel was behind bombings.\n\nOn 14 July 1958, a significant portion of the Iraqi Army under Abdul-Karim Qasim, staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq. The army seized control over Baghdad and stormed the radio station and the Al-Rehab Palace. Many people were brutally killed during the coup, including King Faisal II, former Regent Abd al-Ilah and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and members of the royal family. Many of the royal figures' bodies were dragged through the streets and mutilated. Mob violence emerged and several foreign nationals staying at the Baghdad Hotel, including Americans and Jordanians were killed. New principles were adopted for the city's development. New Baghdad and Sadr City were developed during the reign of Qasim. In 1960, Baghdad hosted an international conference with dignitaries from Iran, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, that founded Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including oil pipelines, modern sewerage, and highways were built. Master plans of the city (1967 and 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. Saddam Hussein sponsored architectural and artwork events, that attracted world's popular architects. The city had a vibrant lifestyle. Baghdad was called as \"Nuremberg of 1930s\" and \"Las Vegas of the 1980s\".\nHowever, the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted to the military and thousands of residents endured devastations. Iran launched a number of missiles and rockets on Baghdad, some of them hitting dangerously close to Al-Rashid Street and the Jewish Quarter. Power plants and oil refineries were damaged. A nuclear reactor near Baghdad was destroyed in an airstrike by Israel. Despite the war, preparations were underway for Baghdad to host a Non-Alignment Movement summit. Conference centers and hotels such as Palestine Hotel, Al-Mansour Hotel and Ishtar Hotel were built. However, the summit was later shifted to New Delhi, due to deteriorating security.\nDuring the Gulf War, Baghdad was the most heavily defended area of Iraq. Initially, U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad failed and resulted a tactical victory for the Iraqi Air Force. Later, the Coalition forces proceeded with aerial bombings. Air defense, communication systems, bridges, chemical weapon facilities, and artilleries were damaged. Oil refineries and airport were targeted. On 13 February 1991, an aerial bombing attack in Amiriya killed at least 408 civilians. Shortly after the end of the war, ethnic Kurds and Shi'a Muslims led uprisings against the government. Clashes took place Shi'a rebels and the Republican Guard led by Qusay Hussein. Sadr City was besieged until the order restored. Another uprising occurred in 1999, after Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr was assassinated in Najaf. Unrest began as large scale protests took place in Shia neighborhoods of Baghdad, specially Saddam City. The Republican Guard deployed in the district suppressed the demonstration, leaving between 27 and 100 dead.\nBaghdad was targeted in frequent U.S. airstrikes. On 26 June 1993, cruise missiles were launched into downtown Baghdad, targeting the intelligence headquarters in the Mansour district. The attack killed nine civilians nearby, including actress and painter Layla Al-Attar. During the 1998 bombing of Iraq, missiles struck multiple locations across Baghdad, including presidential palaces, several Republican Guard barrakcs, and offices of the Ministry of Defense and the Military industry. On February 16, 2001, the U.S. launched air strikes on five military targets at Taji.\n\n21st century (2001–present)\nThe city was economically drained, as a result of the Gulf War and the subsequent embargo against Iraq. By the end of the 1990s, the government made improvements and began rebuilding Baghdad. Government offices, presidential palaces, bridges and roads damaged in the war and follow-up U.S. attacks were restored. The city's airport was reopened, with flights from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Numerous mosques were built as a part of the Faith Campaign. In 2001, a broad initiative came to restore Baghdad's cultural heritage. Older mosques, churches, mandis and synagogues were restored and other historical structures were rebuilt. Under Saddam's architectural vision, a large number of palaces were built around the city. However, these efforts were interrupted by the war which began in 2003.\nIn 2003, the United States-led coalition invaded Iraq. Coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults. The resistance of the Iraqi Army of the city's airport delayed coalition's entry into Baghdad. Following the fall of Baghdad on 9 April 2003, the government lost its power. A statue of Saddam was toppled in Firdous Square, symbolizing the end of his rule. Many of the former government officials were either killed or captured, while others managed to escape and flee. After the overthrow the government, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was formed. CPA's decisions caused a power vacuum. Also two minor riots took place in 2003, on 21 July and 2 October, causing some disturbance in the population. Shortly after the invasion and the fall of the regime, an insurgancy began against the U.S-led rule of Iraq, consisting of former government officers and Islamist groups.\nBombings took place at Jordanian Embassy and Canal Hotel. Religious and ethnic minorities,— Christians, Mandaeans, and Jews, began leaving the city out of fear of being targeted in attacks, as they were subjected to kidnappings, death threats, and violence. The Iraqi Film Archives site was bombed, priceless collection of artifacts in the National Museum was looted, and thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed. The Haifa Street helicopter incident on 12 September was controversial. On the eve of Ashura on 2 March 2004, one of the deadliest bombing took place in Baghdad, that killed at least 80–100 and injured 200 Shi'a Muslims. In 2005, over 965 people were killed in Al-Aimmah Bridge near Al-Kadhimiya Mosque. Attempts were made to rescue people, specially from the Sunni district of Adhamiyah, which is today seen as a symbol of unity.\nCoinciding the execution of Saddam Hussein in 2006, violence increased during the civil war between Shi'ite militias and Sunni insurgents. Shi'ite militias were Muqtada as-Sadr's Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) and the Iranian-backed Special Groups and among Sunni insurgents, the largest was Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Sunni insurgents established their bases Mansour, Adhamiyah and Doura. Mansour district borders the Shi'ite populated Kadhimiyah and East Rasheed. Before 2003, it was home to wealthy Sunnis and Ba'athist officials. Hence, when the regime fell, it quickly became a stronghold for the Sunni insurgency. While Shia militias were based in Sadr City, Kadhimiyah, and West Rasheed, with Bab Al-Sharqi becoming stronghold for the Mahdi Army. Later, they also expanded into the surrounding districts of eastern Baghdad. 9 Nissan, Karadah, and Rusafa were dominated by Shias.\nUnder Operation Imposing Law (Operation Fardh al-Qanoon), the coalition forces and post-2003 Iraqi Army successfully defeated Al-Qaeda and targeted Shia militias. By 2009, the level of violence decreased. However, violence continued. The period surrounding Provincial Elections was remarkably peaceful. But Baghdad witnessed an uptick in attacks in early April 2009, when a series of suicide bomb and vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attacks were perpetrated across the capital.  The war and subsequent occupation ended in 2011, that caused huge damage to Baghdad's transportation, power, and sanitary infrastructure. It resulted in massive civilian casualties, whose number is disputed.\nThough the war ended, but an Islamist insurgency lasted until 2013. Baghdad experienced anti-government protests by Sunnis during the Arab Spring. It was followed by another war from 2013 to 2017 and a low-level insurgency from 2017, which included suicide bombings in January 2018 and January 2021. It has been site of clashes between the citizens and the government. The city attracted global media attention on 3 January 2020, when Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was assassinated in a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad Airport.  In December 2015, Baghdad was selected by UNESCO as the first Arab city of the center of literary creativity.\n\nGeography\nThe city is located on a vast plain bisected by the Tigris river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called \"Risafa\" and the Western half known as \"Karkh\". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of quaternary alluvial origin due to periodic large flooding of the Tigris river. The Diyala river is a tributary of the Tigris, flowing southeast of the city and bordering its eastern suburbs.\nBaghdad is 529.8 kilometres (329.2 mi) northwest of Basra, 402.9 kilometres (250.4 mi) south of Mosul, 366.8 kilometres (227.9 mi) south of Erbil and 103.8 kilometres (64.5 mi) northeast of Karbala. Located to the south is Mahmoudiyah, which serves as the gateway to Baghdad.\n\nClimate\nBaghdad has a hot desert climate (Köppen BWh), featuring extremely hot, prolonged, dry summers and mild to cool, slightly wet, short winters. In the summer, from June through August, the average maximum temperature is as high as 44 °C (111 °F) and accompanied by sunshine. Rainfall has been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded 1 mm (0.04 in). Even at night, temperatures in summer are seldom below 24 °C (75 °F). Baghdad's record highest temperature of 51.8 °C (125.2 °F) was reached on 28 July 2020. Humidity is under 50% in summer, due to Baghdad's distance from both the marshes in southern Iraq and the coasts of the Persian Gulf. Dust storms from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.\nIts winter temperatures are those of a hot desert climate. From December through February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging 16 to 19 °C (61 to 66 °F), with highs possible above 21 °C (70 °F). Lows below freezing occur statistically a couple of times per year.\nAnnual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November through March, averages approximately 150 mm (5.91 in), but has been as high as 338 mm (13.31 in) and as low as 37 mm (1.46 in). On 11 January 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in 100 years. Snowfall was again reported on 11 February 2020, with accumulations across the city.\n\nGovernance\nAdministratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into districts which are further divided into sub-districts. Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues. Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities. The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy. These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S—controlled Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses. The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings.\nEach neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them. Once all 88 neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. Later, the number of official neighborhoods were increased to 89. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council. The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada).\nAs within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:\n\nThe nine districts are subdivided into 89 smaller neighborhoods which may make up sectors of any of the districts above. The following is a selection (rather than a complete list) of these neighborhoods:\n\nNotable streets\nHaifa Street\nHilla Road – Runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk (Baghdad)\nCaliphs Street – site of historical mosques and churches\nAl-Sa'doun Street – stretching from Liberation Square to Masbah\nAbu Nuwas Street – runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge\nDamascus Street – goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road\nMutanabbi Street – A street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi\nRabia Street\n14 July Street (Mosul Road)\nMuthana al-Shaibani Street\nBor Saeed (Port Said) Street\nThawra Street\nAl-Qanat Street – runs through Baghdad north-south\nAl-Khat al-Sare'a – Mohammed al-Qasim (high speed lane) – runs through Baghdad, north–south\nIndustry Street runs by the University of Technology – center of the computer trade in Baghdad\nAl Nidhal Street\nAl-Rasheed Street – city center Baghdad\nAl-Jumhuriya Street – city center Baghdad\nFalastin Street\nTariq al-Muaskar – (Al-Rasheed Camp Road)\nAkhrot street\nBaghdad Airport Road\n\nDemographics\nBaghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015. The surrounding metropolitan region's population is estimated to be 10,500,000. It is second largest city in the Arab world after Cairo and fourth largest metropolitan area in the Middle East after Tehran. At the beginning of the 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad. The 2013–2017 civil war following the Islamic State's invasion in 2014 caused hundreds of thousands of Iraqi internally displaced people to flee to the city.\n\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of Baghdad's ethnic population are Iraqi Arabs, while minority groups include Kurds, Feyli, Kurdish, Turkmen, Assyrians, Kawliya, Circassians, Mandaeans, and Armenians. Post-2003 have left an impact of Baghdad's ethnic composition. In 2003, approximately 500,000 Kurds lived in Baghdad. As of 2016, around 300,000 remained in Baghdad. Among them, about 150,000 are Shi'a mostly of Luri origin. The main Kurdish neighborhood is situated in central Baghdad, known as the Quarter of Kurds (Akd al–Akrad). It is itself home to more than 200 Kurdish families that have lived for generations.\nChristians in Baghdad are predominantly ethnic Assyrians and Armenians. Assyrians began moving to Baghdad by the mid 20th century from northern Iraq and Iran. The historic \"Assyrian Quarter\" of the city – Dora, which boasted a population of 150,000 Assyrians in 2003, made up over 3% of the capital's Assyrian population then.  The community has been subject to kidnappings, death threats, vandalism, and house burnings by al-Qaeda and other insurgent groups. As of the end of 2014, only 1,500 Assyrians remained in Dora and others in Karrada district. Before the war, 25,000 Armenians lived in Iraq, with majority them concentrated in Baghdad. Although the Armenian population has reduced, Baghdad is still home to the largest community of Armenians in Iraq, primarily concentrated in the Armenian quarter of Bab al-Sharqi area.\nAn estimated 60,000 Iraqi Turkmen live in Baghdad, with significant population in the neighborhoods of Adhamiyah and Ragheba Khatun. There is a Circassian neighborhood in the city, which is home to the largest Circassian community of Iraq. The metropolitan area and the adjoining governorate is also home to Kawliya, African Iraqis,  Chechens and other groups.\n\nReligion\nThe majority of the citizens are Muslims with minorities of Christians, Yezidis, Jews and Mandeans also present. There are many religious centers distributed around the city including mosques, churches, synagogues and Mashkhannas cultic huts. The city historically has a predominantly Sunni population, but by the early 21st century around 52% of the city's population were Shi'ites. Sunni Muslims make up 29–34% of Iraq's population and they are still a majority in west and north Iraq. As early as 2003, about 20% of the population of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis. Following the civil war between Sunni and Shia militia groups during the occupation of Iraq, the population of Sunnis significantly decreased as they were pushed out of many neighborhoods. Today majority of the neighborhoods are either entirely Sunni or Shi'ite. While few localities are mixed, such as Yarmouk.\nThe Christian community in Baghdad is divided among various denominations, mainly the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syriac Catholic Church. There is also a significant presence of followers of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Syriac Orthodox Church, along with the largest Armenian Apostolic and Protestant communities in Iraq, which is also located in Baghdad. The city serves as the headquarters of the Chaldean Catholic Church, with its see located in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows, while the Ancient Church of the East has its see in the Cathedral of the Virgin. Before the Iraq War in 2003, Baghdad was home to 300,000–800,000 Christians, primarily concentrated in several neighborhoods with a Christian majority or significant minority, the most notable being Karrada and al–Dora, which had around 150,000 Christians. After 2003, a large number of Christians were displaced in wars and many of them fled to Baghdad after ISIS's takeover of Mosul. Today about 100,000 Christians remained in Baghdad, primarily in Karrada and Mansour district.\nBaghdad was once home to one of the world's most significant Jewish communities. In 1948, Jews numbered approximately 150,000, constituting 33% of the city's population. Persecution forced most Jews to flee Iraq. Even after 1948, up to 100,000 Jews remained, which decreased. Majority of 15,000 Iraqi Jews lived in Baghdad during Saddam Hussein's rule and their population dwindled, not due to persecution but because of lifted travel restrictions that allowed many to emigrate. By 2003, Iraq still had a Jewish community of about 1,500 people, majority of whom resided in Baghdad. But the population decreased sharply after the war. Today, an estimated 160 Jews live in Baghdad out of spotlight, primarily in the old Jewish quarters of Bataween and Shorja, which was once home to vibrant Jewish community. The city was historically home to over 60 synagogues, cemeteries, and shrines, many of which were preserved before 2003. However, their condition deteriorated after the war, and only a few sites, such as the Meir Taweig Synagogue and Al-Habibiyah Jewish Cemetery, remain today.\n\nBeyond their traditional homelands, around Amarah and Basra, Mandaeans are also found in Baghdad. By the late 20th century, Mandaeans began settling in Baghdad for better opportunities. Most of them live primarily around al-Qadisiyah and Dora, which is location to their place of worship and cultural centers. However, persecution of Mandaeans have been greatly decreased since 2003.  There is also a small of community of Baha'is and Sikhs, who live in Baghdad. The Sikhs are mostly Indians. Before 2003, Baghdad was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India.\n\nEconomy\nBaghdad serves as the commercial and financial hub, home to 22% of the population, and generating 40% of the Iraq's GDP. It connects trade routes between Turkey, Syria, India, and Southeast Asia. As the capital, it hosts government institutions and state enterprises, key sources of employment. The public education system follows Ba'athist socialist ideologies, for employment in the public sector. Since 2003, the public sector has struggled to provide jobs, and the private sector hasn't grown sufficiently, leading companies to hire mainly foreigners. To address this, NGOs are establishing incubation centers in the city.\nBaghdad serves as headquarters for important companies of Iraq, such as Iraq National Oil Company, State Organization for Marketing of Oil and Iraqi Airways. Baghdad is home to large insurance companies and banks — Central Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, and Rashid Bank and regional headquarters for First Abu Dhabi Bank, Fransabank and Saudi National Bank. Multinational companies such as Honeywell, Shell, General Electric, SalamAir and Robert Bosch GmbH have established their regional base. Baghdad is also home to Iraq Stock Exchange, that was established in 1992. Most of these establishments are located in Al-Rasheed Street, Karrada and Mansour district.\nIt was once one of the main destinations in the region with a wealth of cultural attractions. Tourism has diminished due to wars, but in recent years the city has a revival in tourism although still facing challenges. There are numerous historic, scientific and artistic museums in Baghdad. Religious tourism in Baghdad has grown since 2003, with sites like Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Abu Hanifa Mosque, Mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, and Buratha Mosque attracting visitors from Iran, Pakistan, and India, while non-religious tourists mainly come from Turkey, France, and the United States. Around 1 million people visit the city annually for religious purposes. The pilgrims are both Shia and Sunni Muslims.\nThe city contains the factories of carpets, leather and textiles, workshops, cement and tobacco factories. Industrial areas extend from the city center to outside and suburbs in the metropolitan area, such as Taji and northern Baghdad. Subsequently, it has produced a wide variety of consumer and industrial goods, including processed foods and beverages, clothes, footwear, wood products, furniture, paper and printed material, bricks, chemicals, plastics, electrical equipment, and metal and nonmetallic products. Bismayah, southeast of Baghdad, is home to world's largest precast factory. In agricultural aspect, palm groves are spread in the city, and many of its people depends on the cultivation of many yields.\nBaghdad, like other provinces such as Babylon, Karbala and Qadissiya, contains metals such as aluminum, ceramics, nickel, manganese and chromium, whose size is not yet known, being recently discovered by local Iraqi cadres lacking experience and mechanisms to determine the size of these explorations. An oilfield is located in eastern Baghdad. It was believed that the quantities of oil is modest, but the drilling disclosed that its size exceeds the initial estimates, and has northern extensions in the province of Salah al-Din, and southern province of Wasit. The city is also home to Dora Refinery, a large oil refinery in Dora, which is the 3rd largest in Iraq in terms of production. The production of it exceeds 200,000 barrels (32,000 m3) per day, while its total production estimated if it was developed up to 120,000 barrels (19,000 m3) per day.\nMost reconstruction efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. Some of the private projects includes  Baghdad Renaissance Plan, Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center, and Central Bank of Iraq Tower. Other project proposed includes Romantic Island and Baghdad Gate. Numerous projects have been also impacted due to corruption. According to a report published by CNBC, there are around 150 entertainment projects planned for the city. Many of them were delayed due to government policies. Also Baghdad has witnessed the opening of dozens of tourist complexes annually with areas reaching 20,000 square metres (4.9 acres) in addition to some major tourism projects with areas exceeding 50,000 square metres (12 acres) with the aim of investment combining trade and tourism as a distinctive economic model. In recent years, Baghdad has also adopted modern economic trends like, establishment of startup hubs, office space and incubation center, as well as development of shopping malls such Baghdad Mall and Dijlah Village.\n\nTransportation\nBaghdad lacks substantial public transportation, and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city. Roads in Baghdad have been known to be especially congested since at least 2003. According to MP Jassim Al-Bukhati in 2021, \"Baghdad's roads are designed to accommodate 700,000 cars, while now there are between 2.5 and 3 million cars on them\". This is because, since 2003, car imports have increased. Since then, river-based water transport has become a popular mode of transport. Use of boats crossing across the river saves time for travelers escaping congestion. Private organizations are working to improve the transport system.\nAmong the major bridges connecting Karkh and Rusafa are 14th of July Bridge, Al-Aimmah Bridge and Al-Sarafiya Bridge. In 2023, the authorities announced plans to build 19 bridges in Baghdad. This is a part of its post-war reconstruction efforts, as many bridges were damaged during the war. Streets, avenues and alleys form an important part of the transport network. Al-Sa'doun Street stretches from Liberation Square to Masbah. Abu Nuwas Street runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge. Damascus Street goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road. Hilla Road runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk. Mutanabbi Street is a street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. Caliphs Street is the site of historical mosques and churches.\n\nAir transport\nIraqi Airways, the national airline of Iraq, operates out of Baghdad International Airport in Baghdad. The airport was opened by Saddam Hussein in 1982 as Saddam International Airport. It was closed as result of the Gulf War and subsequent embargo. The airport was reopened in August 2000. The airport adopted its current name after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nPlanned Baghdad Metro\nThe Baghdad Metro project was first proposed during the 1970s but did not come to fruition due to wars and sanctions. After the Iraq war, Iraqi authorities intended to revive the project, but it was again delayed due to domestic instability. In 2019, it was reported that Korean Hyundai and French Alstom would be building the metro. However, the planned construction did not happen.\nAs of February 2024, the current plan consisted of fully electric and automated (driverless) trains running on an extensive railway network including an underground railway portion as well as an elevated railway. The proposed Baghdad Metro system includes seven main lines with a total length of more than 148 kilometres, 64 metro stations, four workshops and depots for trains, several operations control centers (OCC) and seven main power stations (MPS) with a capacity of 250 mega-watts, and several Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) towers. The metro will be equipped with CCTV and internet as well as USB ports for charging. Special compartments will be allocated for women and children as well as seats for people with special needs, pregnant women, and the elderly. The metro stations will be connected to other public transport networks such as buses and taxis, and 10 parking spaces will be available for commuters. The planned operating speed will be 80–140 km/hour with an estimated 3.25 million riders per day.\nIn July 2024, it was announced that an international consortium of German French, Spanish, and Turkish companies was awarded $17.5 billion contract to construct Baghdad's metro. The consortium includes Alstom, Systra, SNCF, Talgo, Deutsche Bank and SENER. The consortium was then to negotiate the technical, financial and operational details of the project which is now estimated to be completed in May 2029.\n\nCityscape\nThe Round City was the core of the city, during the establishment of Baghdad. It ceased to exist, as a result of the Mongolian siege. Urban features such as streets, avenues, alleyways and squares clusters a large number of landmarks, which itself creates an identity of cultural or intellectual hubs and define the beauty of Baghdad.\nAl-Rasheed Street is one of the most significant landmarks in Baghdad. Located in al-Rusafa area, the street was an artistic, intellectual and cultural center for many Baghdadis. It also included many prominent theaters and nightclubs such as the Crescent Theatre where Egyptian Singer Umm Kulthum sang during her visit in 1932 as well as the Chakmakji Company that recorded the music of various Arab singers. The street also contains famous and well-known landmarks including the ancient Haydar-Khana Mosque as well as numerous well-known cafés such as al-Zahawi Café and the Brazilian Café.\nMutanabbi Street is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al-Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community. Firdos Square is a public open space in Baghdad and the location of two of the best-known hotels, the Palestine Hotel and the Sheraton Ishtar, which are both also the tallest buildings in Baghdad. The square was the site of the statue of Saddam Hussein that was pulled down by the coalition forces in a widely televised event during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nQushla or Qishla is a public square and the historical complex located in al-Rusafa neighborhood at the riverbank of Tigris. The place and its surroundings is where the historical features and cultural capitals of Baghdad are concentrated, from the Mutanabbi Street, Abbasid-era palace and bridges, Ottoman-era mosques to the Mustansariyah Madrasa. The square developed during the Ottoman era as a military barracks. Today, it is a place where the citizens of Baghdad find leisure such as reading poetry in gazebos. It is characterized by the iconic clock tower which was donated by George V. The entire area is submitted to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Tentative list.\n\nArchitecture\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Saddam Hussein's government spent a lot of money on new monuments, mosques, palaces and hotels. The Street is also notable for its architecture and aesthetic which was inspired by Renaissance architecture and also includes the famous Iraqi shanasheel.\n\nModern Landmarks\nThe National Museum of Iraq whose collection of artifacts was looted during the invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple political parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed under Saddam's command.\nGrand Festivities Square is the main square where public celebrations are held and is also the home to three important monuments commemorating Iraqi's fallen soldiers and victories in war; namely Al-Shaheed Monument, the Victory Arch and the Unknown Soldier's Monument. Al-Shaheed Monument, also known as the Martyr's Memorial, is a monument dedicated to the Iraqi soldiers who died in the Iran–Iraq War. However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War. The monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist Ismail Fatah Al Turk. Though these works symbolize the ruling entity. Neverthelsess, they have remained part of architectural legacy, which beautified Baghdad.\nMasjid Al-Kadhimain is a shrine that is located in the Kādhimayn suburb of Baghdad. It contains the tombs of the seventh and ninth Twelver Shi'ite Imams, Musa al-Kadhim and Muhammad at-Taqi respectively, upon whom the title of Kādhimayn (\"Two who swallow their anger\") was bestowed. Many Shi'ites travel to the mosque from far away places to commemorate those imams. A'dhamiyyah is a predominantly Sunni area with a Mosque that is associated with the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifa. The name of Al-Aʿẓamiyyah is derived from Abu Hanifa's title, al-Imām al-Aʿẓam (the Great Imam).\nThe historic Jewish quarters of Bataween and Shorja is home to numerous sites that are associated with Jews. These sites were preserved during the Ba'athist regime. However, after 2003, many of them are in poor conditions. Meir Taweig Synagogue is the only active synagogue of Iraq, which have a large compound, that consist of community center, Jewish school and library. Daniel Market (Souq Danial), which was named after Menahem Saleh Daniel, still bears the same name. It is popular for fabrics and shoes. The Great Synagogue of Baghdad, the oldest synagogue of Iraq, is now restored as a museum. Al-Habibiyah Cemetery is the largest Jewish cemetery in Baghdad, home to around 1,000 graves. The Tomb of Joshua, now a Muslim shrine, is believed to be the burial site of Joshua. Shaykh Yitzhak Tomb and Synagogue was preserved until 2003. Today it is neglected. Other sites includes House of Sassoon Eskell and library of Mir Basri.\nThe Sabian–Mandaean Mandi of Baghdad is a Mandaen temple in al-Qadisiyyah. It is the main community center for Mandaeans in Iraq. Plans are underway to demolish and build a larger one to accommodate more worshippers. A cultural institute for Mandeans is also in Baghdad. The city is home to Baba Nanak Shrine, a sacred site in Sikhism. It was destroyed during the Iraq War in 2003. In the Kadhimiya district of Baghdad, was the house of Baháʼu'lláh, (Prophet Founder of the Baha'i Faith) also known as the \"Most Great House\" (Bayt-i-Aʻzam) and the \"House of God\", where Baháʼu'lláh mostly resided from 1853 to 1863. It is considered a holy place and a place of pilgrimage by Baha'is according to their \"Most Holy Book\". On 23 June 2013, the house was destroyed under unclear circumstances.\n\nBaghdad Zoo used to be the largest zoological park in the Middle East. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. Conservationist Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Eventually Paul Bremer, Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the invasion, ordered protection for the zoo and enlisted U.S. engineers to help reopen the facility. Al-Zawraa Park is also part of the zoo, which is main urban park of the city.\n\nEducation\nThe House of Wisdom was a major academy and public center in Baghdad. The Mustansiriya Madrasa was established in 1227 by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir. The name was changed to al-Mustansiriya University in 1963. The University of Baghdad is the largest university in Iraq and the second largest in the Arab world. Prior to the Gulf War, multiple international schools operated in Baghdad, including:\n\nÉcole française de Bagdad\nDeutsche Schule Bagdad\nBaghdad Japanese School (バグダッド日本人学校), a nihonjin gakko\n\nUniversities\nUniversity of Baghdad\nMustansiriya University\nIraqi University\nNahrain University\nAlbayan University\nUniversity of Technology\nAmerican University of Iraq - Baghdad\nAl-Turath University College\nDijlah University College\n\nCulture\nBaghdad has always played a significant role in the broader Arab cultural sphere, contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Historically, the city had a vibrant modern culture and lifestyle. Famous Arab poets and singers such as Nizar Qabbani, Umm Kulthum, Fairuz, Salah Al-Hamdani, Ilham al-Madfai and others have performed for the city. The dialect of Arabic spoken in Baghdad today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, The Arabic Language). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late Middle Ages. For poetry written about Baghdad, see Reuven Snir (ed.), Baghdad: The City in Verse (Harvard, 2013). Baghdad joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature in December 2015.\nSome of the important cultural institutions in the city include the National Theater, which was looted during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but efforts are underway to restore the theater. The live theater industry received a boost during the 1990s, when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theaters were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions. Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad and the Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad. The Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Mandaeans had cultural club in Al-Zawraa, where poetry evenings and cultural seminars were held, attended by poets, writers, artists, officials, and dignitaries of the communities. There is also a social cultural center of Mandaeans at al-Qadisiyyah. Baghdad Jewish Community Center is located in Al-Rashid Street.\nBaghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed artifacts and relics of ancient civilization; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.\nDuring occupation of Iraq, AFN Iraq (\"Freedom Radio\") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called \"Dijlah\" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the Jamia neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.\n\nSport\nBaghdad is home to some of the most successful football (soccer) teams in Iraq, the biggest being Al-Shorta (Police), Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya (Air Force), Al-Zawraa, and Al-Talaba (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is Al-Shaab Stadium, which was opened in 1966. In recent years, the capital has seen the building of several football stadiums which are meant be opened in near future. The city has also had a strong tradition of horse racing ever since World War I, known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo, Egypt\n Baku, Azerbaijan\n Pyongyang, North Korea\n Tehran, Iran\n Amman, Jordan\n Damascus, Syria\n Beirut, Lebanon\n Jerusalem (East), Palestine\n Bucharest, Romania\n\nSee also\nIraqi art\nList of mosques in Baghdad\nList of places in Iraq\nHistory of the Jews in Baghdad\nBattle of Baghdad (2003)\nBaghdad Ziyarat Tour\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nDefrémery, C.; Sanguinetti, B.

      "summary": "Baghdad is the capital and largest city in Iraq. It is located on the banks of the Tigris in central Iraq. The city has an estimated population of 8 million. It ranks among the most populous and largest cities in the Middle East and the Arab world and constitutes 22% of the country's population. Baghdad is a primary financial and commercial center in the region.\nFounded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into an intellectual and cultural center. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the \"Center of Learning\". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an, as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues, shift in power and multiple successive empires. Later, Baghdad served as the administrative center of Ottoman Iraq, exercising authority over the provinces of Basra, Mosul, and Shahrizor.\nDuring the First World War, Baghdad was made the capital of Mandatory Iraq. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. During the Ba'ath Party rule, the city experienced a period of relative prosperity and growth. However, it faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During the insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare. Since the end of the war, numerous reconstruction projects have been underway to induce stability.\nIraq's largest city, Baghdad is the seat of government. It generates 40% of the economy of Iraq. A major center of Islamic history, Baghdad is home to numerous historic mosques, as well as churches, mandis and synagogues, highlighting the city's historical diversity. Religious sites such as Masjid al-Kadhimayn, Buratha Mosque, the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Abu Hanifa Mosque are visited by millions of people annually. It was once home to a large Jewish community and was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India. Baghdad is a regional cultural hub. The city is well known for its coffeehouses.",

      "content": "بَغْدَاد هيَ عَاصِمَة جُمْهُوريَّة العِرَاق، ومَرْكَزُ محافظة بَغْدَاد. في عام 2016 بلغَ عَددُ سُكانها حَوالي 8.5 مَليون نَسَمة، مَا يَجعَلها أكبر مَدِينة في العِرَاق وثانِي أكبر مَدِينة في الوَطَنِ العَرَبي بَعْد القَاهِرةِ. وتأتي بالمَرتبة 40 عالميًا من حيث عدد السكان. وتُعد المَدِينة المَركز الاقْتِصَاديّ والإدَاريّ والتَعليمِيّ في الدَّوْلَة.\nبناها الخليفة العباسي أبو جعفر المنصور في القرن الثامن الميلادي واتخذها عاصمةً للدولة العباسية؛ أصبح لبغداد بعدها مكانة عظيمة، فكانت أهم مراكز العلم على تنوعه في العالم وملتقى للعلماء والدارسين لعدة قرون من الزمن. وتمثل بغداد حاليًا حالةً من حالات التتابع المدني في إطار موقع واحد، ففي إطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمة إلى سلوقية الإغريقية وطيسفون الفارسية، التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى، ثم بغداد العربية الحالية.\nكانت بغداد أكبر مدينة في العالم لمُعظم فَترة حُكْم بَنو العَباس خلال العصر الذهبي الإسلامي، بِحَيث بلغَ عَدد سُكانها أكثر من مِليون نَسمة. وصلت مدينة بغداد لذروتها في عصر الخليفة العباسي الخامس هارون الرشيد وارتبطت باسمه في روايات ألف ليلة وليلة ذات الشهرة العالمية، حيث باتت عاصمة العالم القديم. وقد فقدت هذه المكانة منذ عام 1258 عندما غزاها المغول والتتار. مع حلول بدايات القرن السادس عشر، تبادل الصفويون والعثمانيون السيطرة على المدينة، حتى انتزعها العثمانيون أخيراً في عام 1535، فظلت تحت حكمهم قرابة 4 قرون. وفي عام 1917، سيطر الإنجليز على المدينة، وقد خضعت كمعظم مناطق العراق الأخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني، ثم أصبحت عاصمة للمملكة العراقية عام 1921، والجمهورية العراقية عام 1958.\nتكمن أهمية موقع بغداد الجغرافي في توافر المياه وتناقص أخطار الفيضانات، ما أدى بدوره إلى اتساع رقعة المدينة وزيادة نفوذها إلى جانب سهولة اتصالها عبر نهر دجلة بواسطة الجسور التي تربطها عبر جوانب النهر، والذي يخترق مركزها لينصفه إلى جُزْأَين هما الكرخ والرصافة. وتتشكل المدينة اليوم من 27 منطقة، تنقسم بدورها إلى عدة أحياء.\nتمتاز بغداد بأهميتها الثقافية التي تتمثل بوجود عدد كبير من الصروح المهمة كالمتاحف والمدارس التاريخية والمكتبات والمسارح. وتشتهر المدينة بآثارها الإسلامية التي تتمثل ببقايا أسوار مدينة بغداد، ودار الخلافة، والمدرسة المستنصرية. ولبغداد القديمة أسماء عدة كالمدينة المدورة والزوراء ودار السلام.\n\nالتاريخ\nأظهرت التنقيبات الأثرية أن بغداد كانت في الفترات القديمة موطنًا بشريًا مهما يعود إلى العصر الآشوري قبل اختيارها لتكون عاصمة للخلافة العباسية. ومما جعل لهذا الموقع أهميته الجغرافية والاستراتيجية توسطه مدنًا حضارية إنسانية كبرى تمتد من شمال العراق إلى جنوبه. إن هذا الموقع الجغرافي التاريخي جعل بغداد تتبوأ موقعًا متوسطًا بين تلك المدن الأمر الذي شكل بيئة ملائمة لتطور الإنسان وإنجازاته الحضارية والفكرية. وفي العصور التي سبقت الفتح الإسلامي وما بعده، كانت المنطقة التي عرفت في بغداد في العهد العباسي تحيط بها مدن لها أهميتها الاستراتيجية والجغرافية. وتقع مدينة بغداد شمال موقع مدينة بابل الأثرية، إضافةً إلى أنها تقع على بعد بضعة كيلومترات شمال غرب مدينة قطيسفون (المدائن) التي بناها الإغريق قبل الميلاد وورثها الفرس، والتي استمرت كمركز رئيس للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في القرن الثامن.\n\nبُنيت بغداد في العصر العباسي بين عاميّ 762 و 764 م. وأُطلق عليها في القديم اسم الزوراء، ومدينة السلام، وكانت ذات يوم عاصمة الدنيا، ومركز الخلافة الإسلامية العباسية. بناها الخليفة العباسي أبو جعفر المنصور، وسماها مدينة المنصور، وجعل لها أربعةُ أبواب هي: باب خُراسان، (وكان يسمى باب الدولة)، وبابُ الشام، ثم بابُ الكوفةِ، ثم باب البصرة. وكان المنصور قد اختار لها هذه البقعة من الأرض على ضفتي نهر دجلة. تزخرُ بغدادُ بالكثيرِ من المعالمِ التاريخية والحضارية، أهمها المدرسة المستنصرية، والمساجد الإسلامية القديمة، والقصور الأثرية، وبها عدد من المقامات الدينية، أهمها مقاما الإمامين موسى الكاظم ومحمد الجواد بالكاظمية، ومقام أبي حنيفة النعمان، ومقام الشيخ عبد القادر الجيلاني وجامع الخلفاء العباسي المعروف قديمًا بجامع القصر أو جامع الخليفة، وجامع الحيدرخانة وهو من أتقنِ جوامع بغداد صِنعة وإحكامًا\nيوجد بالمدينة متاحف تعرض فيه الآثار المختلفة من جواهر وعملات وهياكل بشرية وتماثيل من عصور ما قبل التاريخ حتى القرن السابع عشر الميلادي.\n\nالعصر العباسي\nكان سبب بناء بغداد في العصر العباسي، أن أبو جعفر المنصور بنى الهاشمية قبالة مدينة ابن هبيرة بينهما عرض الطريق، وكانت مدينة ابن هبيرة التي بحيالها مدينة أبي جعفر الهاشمية إلى جانب الكوفة، وبنى المنصور أيضاً مدينة بظهر الكوفة سماها الرصافة. فلما ثارت الراوندية بأبي جعفر في مدينته التي تسمى الهاشمية، كره سكناها لاضطراب من اضطرب أمره عليه من الراوندية مع قرب جواره من الكوفة ولم يأمن أهلها على نفسه فأراد أن يبعد من جوارهم فذكر أنه خرج بنفسه يرتاد لها موضعاً يتخذه مسكناً لنفسه وجنده ويبتني به مدينة فبدأ فانحدر إلى جرجرايا ثم صار إلى بغداد ثم مضى إلى الموصل ثم عاد إلى بغداد فقال هذا موضع معسكر صالح هذه دجلة ليس بيننا وبين الصين شيء يأتينا فيها كل ما في البحر وتأتينا الميرة من الجزيرة وأرمينيا وما حول ذلك وهذا الفرات يجيء فيه كل شيء من الشام والرقة وما حول ذلك فنزل وضرب عسكره على الصراة وخط المدينة ووكل بكل ربع قائدًا.\nاختار أبو جعفر المنصور موقع بغداد على رقعة مرتفعة من الأرض على الجانب الغربي من نهر دجلة عند مصب نهر الرفيل فيه والتي بدأ العمل في بنائها بتاريخ الثالث والعشرين من تموز من عام سبعمئة واثنان وستين ميلادية. وكانت تحيط بهذا الموقع قرى مأهولة السكان مزدهرة أهمها: بغداد البالية القديمة، وسونيا الآرامية، والخطابية، وشرفانية، وبناورا، وورثاه، وبراثا، وقطغتا، والوردانية. وكان هناك جسر على دجلة، و دير للنصارى. وكانت الأرض التي تحيطها سهلة زراعية تسقيها مياه ترع تتفرع من نهر الرفيل الواسع الذي يأخذ من نهر الفرات ويبعد عن بغداد نحو 30 كيلومترا، ومن نهر الدجيل الذي يأخذ مياهه من دجلة في شماليها. وهذه الأراضي المزروعة كانت واسعة تنتج محاصيل زراعية وافرة، ويقابلها في شرقي دجلة أراض منبسطة أيضاً تروي مزارعها أنهار وترع عدة.\nمن جهة أخرى، ذُكر عن عيسى بن المنصور أنه قال: \"وجدت في خزائن أبي المنصور في الكتب أنه أنفق على مدينة السلام وجامعها وقصر الذهب بها والأسواق والفصلان والخنادق وقبابها وأبوابها أربعة آلاف ألف وثمانمئة وثلاثين درهماً ومبلغها من الفلوس مئة ألف ألف فلس وثلاثة وعشرون ألف فلس وذلك أن الأستاذ من البنائين كان يعمل يومه بقيراط فضة والروزكاي بحبتين إلى ثلاث حبات. وكانت مدينة بغداد مدورة ويبلغ طول قطرها نحو 2615 مترا، وأحيطت بخندق وسورين بينهما ساحة واسعة. ورسم في داخلها سكك (شوارع أو أزقة) عديدة على كل منها عدد من الطاقات، وكل هذه السكك مستقيمة تمتد من السور إلى رحبة واسعة في وسط المدينة المدورة، وخص المنصور أبا حنيفة النعمان بالإشراف عليها فكان المشرف العام على بنائها أربعة أعوام، وعندما انتهى البناء نقل مجالس علمه إليها، حتى توفي في عام 150 هـ.\n\nبتولِي هارون الرشيد الحكم بدأ عصر زاهر كان واسطة العقد في تاريخ الدولة العباسية التي دامت أكثر من خمسة قرون، ارتقت فيه العلوم، وسمت الفنون والآداب، وعمَّ الرخاء ربوع الدولة الإسلامية. ولقد أمسك هارون الرشيد بزمام هذه الدولة وهو في نحو الثانية والعشرين من عمرهِ، فأخذ بيدها إلى ما أبهر الناس من مجدها وقوتها وازدهار حضارتها.\n\nأصدر الرشيد عند توليه الخلافة عفوا عاما أمن كل من كان هاربا أو مستخفيا عدا بعض الزنادقة.\nوأنشأ بما يعرف ببيت الحكمة في بغداد وزوّدها بأعداد كبيرة من الكتب والمؤلفات من مختلف بقاع الأرض. وكانت تضم غرفًا عديدة تمتد بينها أروقة طويلة، وخُصصت بعضها للكتب، وبعضها للمحاضرات، وبعضها الآخر للناسخين والمترجمين والمجلدين. كما تمت في عهده أول ترجمة إلى العربية لأشهر كتاب علمي عرف في التاريخ وهو \"كتاب الأصول (الأركان) في الهندسة والعدد لإقليدس ، وتطورت العلوم خصوصًا الفيزياء الفلكية والتقنية، وابتكرت عدد من الاختراعات كالساعة المائية. كما أنشئ في عهده أول مصنع للورق ببغداد سنة 795 م وصار سوق الوراقين لاحقا الذي يضم مئات الحوانيت التي تبيع السلع الورقية الفاخرة مفخرة عاصمة العباسيين وكان ورق بغداد يقدر تقديرا عاليا في المنطقة حتى أن بعض المصادر البيزنطية تسمي الورق بصحف بغداد (Bagdatixon) في ربط مباشر بينه وبين مدينة بغداد\nأنشأ الخليفة العباسي هارون الرشيد أكبر مستشفى في بغداد، سماها بإسمه، ضمت في كادرها أمهر الأطباء، وتولى إدارتها كل من يوحنا بن ماسويه وجبريل بن بختيشوع، وكانت أشهر مستشفى في العالم القديم.\nاهتم هارون الرشيد بالإصلاحات الداخلية فبنى المساجد الكبيرة والقصور الفخمة وفي عهده استعملت القناديل لأول مرة في إضاءة الطرقات والمساجد. اعتنى الرشيد أيضًا بالزراعة وأسس نظامها، فبنت حكومته الجسور والقناطر الكبيرة وحفرت الترع والجداول الموصلة بين الأنهار، وأسس ديوانًا خاصًا للإشراف على تنفيذ تلك الأعمال الإصلاحية، ومن أعماله أيضًا تشجيع التبادل التجاري بين الولايات وحراسة طرق التجارة بين المدن، وقد شيّد مدينة الواقفة قرب مدينة الرقة على ضفاف الفرات لتكون مقرًا صيفيًا لحكمه.\nغدت بغداد قبلة طلاب العلم من جميع البلاد، يرحلون إليها حيث كبار الفقهاء والمحدثين والقراء واللغويين، وكانت المساجد الجامعة تحتضن دروسهم وحلقاتهم العلمية التي كان كثير منها أشبه بالمدارس العليا، من حيث غزارة العلم، ودقة التخصص، وحرية الرأي والمناقشة، وثراء الجدل والحوار. كما جذبت المدينة الأطباء والمهندسين وسائر الصناع. وكان الرشيد نفسه يميل إلى أهل الأدب والفقه والعلم، حتى ذاع صيت الرشيد وطبق الآفاق ذكره، وأرسلت بلاد الهند والصين وأوروبا رسلها إلى بلاطهِ تخطب وده، وتطلب صداقته.وقع خلاف بعد عامين من وفاة الرشيد بين ولديه الأمين والمأمون، وحوصرت بغداد لأول مرة في تاريخها ودام الحصار أربعة عشر شهراً. وفي نهاية عام 812 أطبق جند هرثمة وطاهر قائدي المأمون على الأمين في بغداد وعزل هرثمة الجانب الشرقي الذي لم يكن يحميه سوى سور سرعان ما أزاله، بينما عسكر طاهر أمام باب الأنبار فسيطر بذلك على الجانب الغربي، ووجد الخليفة نفسه آخر الأمر منعزلاً في قصر الخلد على شاطئ دجلة وما لبث أن وقع في الأسر وهو يحاول الفرار وقُتل في أوائل عام 814، وبموته رُفع الحصار وأصبحت بغداد المزدهرة خرائب ورماداً، وأثار موت الأمين سخط أهل بغداد، وتمكن إبراهيم بن المهدي العباسي بفضل الخلاف بين الناس من أن يستولي على بغداد ويصبح صاحب الأمر فيها ما يقرب من عامين غير أن خيانة قواده أجبرته على تسليم المدينة وزمام الحكم إلى الخليفة المأمون. وكانت بطانة المأمون من الفرس تحاول نقل عاصمة الخلافة إلى خراسان ليتم لهم التغلب على شئون الدولة، وتولى الحسن بن سهل العراق والحجاز واليمن فاضطرب حبل الأمن ودبت الفتن في بغداد إلى أن دخلها المأمون عام 820، وعادت لبغداد شيء من نضرتها إلى أن أدركته منيته عام 834، وقد عهد المأمون بالخلافة من بعده لأخيه المعتصم، وظلت بغداد تموج بالفتن حتى أنه في عام 1157 لم يبقَ من تلك المملكة المترامية الأطراف إلا بغداد وأعمالها وقليل مما يتصل بها. وقد انتقلت العاصمة العباسية في زمن المعتصم عام 837 من بغداد إلى سامراء، وقد أعادها الخليفة العباسي المعتمد عام 893 إلى بغداد، وأقام في دار الخلافة بالجانب الشرقي من نهر دجلة.\nفي منتصف القرن العاشر، استولى آل بويه على بغداد، والذين يرجع نسبهم إلى ملوك الفرس الساسانيين. وقد كان ذلك الاستيلاء في عام 945 بقيادة أحمد معز الدولة، والذي أعلن نفسه حاميا على الخلافة حتى 1055، حيث كان حكم الخليفة في بغداد صوريًا. وقد شجّع البويهيون على نشر المذهب الشيعي في المنطقة. تصارعت فروع الأسرة فيما بينها فعمت الاضطرابات أرجاء الدولة. انتهى الأمر بأن قُسمت دولة إلى فرعين، أولهما في العراق والآخر في كرمان. قضى الغزنويون على فرع البويهيين في الري سنة 1023، ثم أنهى السلاجقة ما تبقى من دولتهم وحلوا محلهم في بغداد.\nينتمي السلاجقة إلى إحدى العشائر المتزعمة لقبائل الغز التركية. وقد توسعت الدولة السلجوقية في أنحاء مختلفة من تركيا وإيران، حتى استولت على العراق سنة 1055، بعد القضاء على دولة البويهيين في بغداد، وأعلنوا نفسهم كحاميين للخلافة العباسية. وقد استمر حكمهم لأراضٍ شاسعة حتى قضى عليهم الخوارزمشاهات سنة 1194.\n\nالمغول والتتار\nكان المغول تحت قيادة جنكيز خان قد دمروا ولاية خوارزم شاه عند وفاة الخليفة أبو العباس أحمد الناصر لدين الله في 1225، واحتلوا معظم أقسام إيران الشمالية. تمكن جيش الخليفة العباسي المستنصر، حفيد الناصر من دحر الهجوم المغولي على أراضي العراق العربية. وتحت حكم ابنه المستعصم، حاصر المغول بغداد في 1245 دون تحقيق نجاح. إلا أن الفيضانات الفظيعة التي حدثت في الأعوام 1243، 1253، 1255 و 1256 خلخلت دفاعات المدينة، وخيرات المنطقة وثقة المواطنين.\nفي عام 1258، طُوقت بغداد بقوة مغولية كبيرة يقودها هولاكو، حفيد جنكيزخان، الذي كان قد أُرسل من منغوليا خصوصًا لكي يتعامل مع العباسيين. وقد سقطت المدينة في 10 شباط/ فبراير 1258، كما اندلعت في أثنائها نيران فتن داخلية انتهت باستيلاء التتار عليها وبقتل الخليفة المستعصم وأولاده ورجال حاشيته وأهل بطانته، وباستباحة بغداد مدة طويلة، وكانت بغداد حين حاصرها المغول غاصة بأهل الأطراف من الذين أجفلوا أمام الجيش المغولي الذين لم يرحموا شيخاً ولا طفلاً ولا امرأة، وبهذا أفلت شمس الخلافة العباسية في بغداد بعد أن أشرقت عليها أكثر من خمسة قرون، وكان أفولها كارثة على الأمم الإسلامية كافة. وقد أبقى هولاكو في أول الأمر الأوضاع الإدارية في بغداد على النمط العباسي تقريباً، ورتب جماعة من الرقباء والأمناء ليشرفوا على كل شيء، وبذلك أصبحت حكومة بغداد مدنية تحت إشراف حكومة عسكرية.\n\nلقد دمّر المغول معظم مدينة بغداد فعليا، ويُقال أن 800,000 نسمة من سكانها قد أبيدوا. كما خُفضت منزلة المدينة إداريا إلى مركز ولاية. أما بقية المدن في المنطقة العربية من العراق مثل الحلة والكوفة والبصرة فقد رضخت إلى شروط الغازي وأبقيت على حالتها. أما الموصل في شمال العراق فقد أصبحت عاصمة ولاية دياربكر وديار ربيعة. كانت هاتان الولايتان تابعتين مثل المناطق العربية في العراق إلى سياسة دولة الخان الثانية المغولية، والتي كان مقرها في أذربيجان، التي بدورها كانت تابعة إلى دولة الخان العظيم في الصين.\nلقد خلفت بغداد مدن عدة في المنطقة مثل تبريز، والتي ظهرت كمركز تجاري رئيس وقاعدة سياسية في المنطقة. أخذ حكم المغول في بغداد والموصل عموما طابع الحكم المشترك الذي يشمل الإداريين المدنين من المسلمين والمسيحين واليهود يسندهم آمر معسكر المغول. وبصورة عامة فإن العراق مر بفترة من الانهيار السياسي والاقتصادي استمر لغاية القرن السادس عشر.\nفي منتصف القرن الرابع عشر، حكم الجلائريون بغداد. وهم أحد العشائر المغولية، لكنها تنتمي إلى تجمع قبائل مختلف عن الذي ينحدر منه جنكيز خان، كما كان مواطنهم في بلاد ما وراء النهر. وقد انتزع الشيخ حسن برزك السلطة في بغداد سنة 1336، ثم حكم بصفة مستقلة منذ 1340. تنازعت هذه السلالة مع القائد المغولي تيمورلنك لحكم العراق، مما أدى به إلى غزو بغداد وطردهم منها سنة 1393. وقد عاد الجلائريون مرة أخرى سنة 1395 إلى المدينة، ثم كانت النتيجة أن عاد إليها تيمورلنك، ودمرها عن آخرها سنة 1401. عاد الجلائريون مجددا إلى بغداد سنة 1406، فقامت قبائل القراقويونلو (الخراف السود) التركمانية بإجلاء آخر الجلائريين عن بغداد سنة 1411. بقي للأسرة حكام في كل من البصرة وخراسان، واستمروا حتى سنة 1432، عندما قضى التركمان عليهم نهائيًا. وظلت بغداد تحت الحكم التركماني من هذا التاريخ حتى عام 1509.\n\nالصفويون والعثمانيون\nسيطر الصفويون على المدينة في عام 1509 بقيادة الشاه إسماعيل الصفوي. وبقيت تحت حكم الصفويين حتى انتزعها العثمانيون من يد الصفويين عام 1535، ولكن ما لبث الصفويون أن عادوا ليسيطروا عليها عام 1624م، وحدثت فيها مذبحة عند دخول جيش الشاه، وبقت تحت الحكم الصفوي حتى عام 1639م، حيث دخلها السلطان العثماني مراد الرابع عام 1638م.\n\nمن جهة أخرى، شهدت بغداد في الفترة الممتدة من 1749 – 1831 حكم مماليك العراق حيث لم يكن للعثمانيين دور مباشر في حكم العراق. وقد بلغت دولة المماليك في العراق أوج قوتها في عهد سليمان باشا الكبير والذي دام حكمه 22 عاما (أنظر: تاريخ بغداد بعد سقوط المماليك).\nكانت بغداد تحت الحكم العثماني مركزا لإيالة بغداد ابتداء من عام 1535 وحتى عام 1864، حيث أصبحت بعدها مركزا لولاية بغداد. وقد تأسست بلدية المدينة في عام 1868، كما تم تعيين إبراهيم الدفتري أول رئيس بلدية لها. وتمثل سنة 1869 أهمية كبيرة في تاريخ بغداد في العصر العثماني، حيث بدأ فيها ما يمكن اعتباره عهدًا متميزًا من عهود العثمانيين وضع أسسه الوالي مدحت باشا بتطبيقه لعدد من الأنظمة والقوانين الإصلاحية التي شرعتها الدولة خلال عهد الإصلاحات وإعادة البناء الذي أطلق عليه عهد التنظيمات. وكان من مُجمل أهمية بغداد للعثمانيين أن جعلوا مقر الفيلقِ السادس في الجيش العثماني في المدينة. وقد بقيت بغداد تحت الحكم العثماني حتى سقوط الدولة العثمانية وقدوم الإنجليز في عام 1917.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nكان أول نزول للقوات البريطانية على أرض العراق في شهر أيلول/ سبتمبر سنة 1914 من منطقة الفاو، وهي بلدة تقع أقصى الجنوب تطل على الخليج العربي. وقد أرسلت القوات البريطانية من الهند بقصد إزاحة العثمانيين عن الخليج وحماية منشآت النفط في جنوب غرب إيران. حتى وصلت بغداد بعد جهود وخسائر كبيرة بعد أكثر من سنتين ونصف السنة، دافعت خلالها القوات العثمانية دفاعاً مستميتًا.\nوفي يوم الأحد 11 آذار/ مارس 1917، سقطت بغداد بقيادة الجنرال البريطاني ستانلي مود، بعد سلسلة من الانتصارات في يد الجيش البريطاني خلال القتال مع الأتراك العثمانيين في الحرب العالمية الأولى، كما وقعت بغداد كمعظم مناطق العراق الأخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nلم تمر إلا سنوات قليلة حتى انتشرت الروح الوطنية بين العراقيين للتحرر من السيطرة البريطانية بسبب قرار الحكومة البريطانية ربط العراق بالكومنولث البريطاني، وقرارها بتشكيل الإدارة المدنية في العراق، التي ترأسها السير أرنولد ويلسون حتى أيار 1918 فتبعه السير بيرسي كوكس الذي ألغى العديد من المؤسسات الإدارية العثمانية، وانشأ محلها مؤسسات عسكرية لإدارة الشؤون المدنية، ووضع على رأسها ضباطًا من رتب عالية، فحكموا بشكل صارم، وتصرفوا مع العراقيين بشكل مهين. فكان لتلك التصرفات ردود أفعال معاكسة من قبل العراقيين، مما أدى إلى انطلاق ثورة شعبية عام 1920 لتمتد في كل أجزاء العراق، سُميت بثورة العشرين، وقد استمرت ستة أشهر تقريباً.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nأصبحت بغداد عاصمة لمملكة العراق بعد عام 1921. وقد مُنح العراق الاستقلال رسميًا في عام 1932، وزاد استقلاله في عام 1946. ازداد عدد سكان المدينة من 145,000 المقدر في عام 1900 إلى 580,000 في عام 1950.\nقام أعضاء في «المربع الذهبي» في 1 نيسان/ أبريل 1941، ورشيد عالي الكيلاني بانقلاب في بغداد. عمل رشيد علي تثبيت حكومة موالية للألمان وإيطاليا المؤيدتان لاستبدال حكومة عبد الإله بن علي الهاشمي الموالية لبريطانيا. في 31 أيار/ مايو، بعد الثورة وبعد فرار رشيد علي وحكومته، استسلم رئيس بلدية بغداد للقوات البريطانية والكومنولث. حدثت عقب الفوضى التي أعقبت سقوط حكومة رشيد عالي الكيلاني خلال انقلاب 1941 أعمال عنف ونهب نشبت في بغداد بالعراق واستهدفت سكان المدينة من اليهود في 1 حزيران/ يونيو 1941 خلال احتفالهم بعيد الشفوعوت اليهودي،  قبل أن تتمكن القوات البريطانية من السيطرة على المدينة. انتهت الحادثة في اليوم التالي لدى دخول البريطانيين بغداد وراح ضحيتها حوالي 175 قتيلا و 1،000 جريحا يهوديا، كما تم تدمير حوالي 900 منزلا تابعا لليهود.\nتركت هذه الحادثة أثرا عميقا لدى اليهود العراقيين وساعدت على سرعة هجرتهم إلى فلسطين. فبحلول عام 1951 هاجر أكثر من 80% منهم من العراق.\nفي 14 تموز/ يوليو 1958، قام أفراد من الجيش العراقي بقيادة عبد الكريم قاسم بانقلاب للإطاحة بمملكة العراق. تم إعلان قيام الجمهورية العراقية وانتهاء حقبة العهد الملكي من خلال البيان الأول للحركة والذي أذاعه عبد السلام عارف من دار الإذاعة، وذلك بعد نجاحه في قلب نظام الحكم وقتل الملك فيصل الثاني، وقاموا بالسيطرة على القيادة العامة للجيش ودار الإذاعة ومجمع بدالة الهاتف المركزي، من خلال قطاعات اللواء العشرين الذي تحت إمرته.\nفي 17 تموز/ يوليو 1968، قام حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي بالتحالف مع ضباط بعثيين بانقلاب على الرئيس عبد الرحمن عارف الذي استلم الحكم بعد وفاة أخيه عبد السلام عارف. وقد تم تعيين أحمد حسن البكر رئيسا لمجلس قيادة الثورة ورئيساً للجمهورية وقائدًا عامًا للجيش وأصبح صدام حسين نائب رئيس مجلس قيادة الثورة، كما أصبح نائب رئيس الجمهورية في عام 1972. يصف الكثير من العراقيين فترة البكر بالعصر الذهبي لبغداد، إذ قام العراق بتأميم النفط والقضاء على الأمٌية والبطالة.\nاستلم الرئيس صدام حسين الحكم في عام 1979. وسرعان ما أدخل البلاد في حرب مع إيران دامت ثماني سنوات ابتداءً من عام 1980. ولم تدم فترة السلم إلا عامين حتى غزى الكويت عام 1990، لتبدأ حرب الخليج الثانية على العراق بقيادة قوات التحالف. وقد تم تدمير الكثير من البنى التحتية للعاصمة بغداد من طرق وجسور وحتى محطات توليد الكهرباء. كما تم بعدها فرض حصار اقتصادي على العراق دام لمدة 13 عام حتى سقوط حكم حزب البعث في العراق عام 2003.\n\nالاحتلال الأمريكي\n\nشنّت الولايات المتحدة حربًا على العراق في عام 2003 بحجة وجود أسلحة للدمار الشامل. وبعد ثلاثة أسابيع من بداية الحملة، بدأت القوات الأمريكة تحركها نحو العاصمة بغداد. كان التوقع الأولي أن تقوم القوات المدرعة الأمريكية بحصار المدينة وتقوم بحرب شوارع في بغداد بإسناد من القوة الجوية الأمريكية، خاصة بعد المعارك التي حدثت مع القوات العراقية في الجنوب.\nأعلنت القوات الأمريكية في 9 نيسان/ أبريل 2003 بسط سيطرتها على معظم المناطق بعد انهيار الدفاعات العراقية بشكل مفاجئ، ونقلت وكالات الأنباء مشاهد لحشد صغير يحاولون الإطاحة بتمثال للرئيس العراقي صدام حسين في وسط ساحة الفردوس، والتي قاموا بها بمساعدة من ناقلة دبابات أمريكية وقام المارينز بوضع العلم الأمريكي على وجه التمثال ليستبدلوه بعلم العراق فيما بعد، بعد أن أدركوا أن للأمر رموزًا ومعاني قد تثير المشاكل. وقد تولى القائد العسكري الأمريكي تومي فرانكس قيادة العراق في تلك الفترة باعتباره القائد العام للقوات الأمريكية.\nتسبب هذا الغزو بأضرار كبيرة في بغداد شملت جميع القطاعات بما فيها النقل، الطاقة، البنية التحتية والصحة. ولا تزال المدينة تعاني من نتائج هذه الحرب إلى اليوم.\nالوضع الحالي\nبدأ انسحاب القوات الأمريكية من العراق في عام 2009، واستمر لعامين، حيث غادر آخر جندي أمريكي البلاد في 18 كانون الأول/ ديسمبر 2011. وقد أتى هذا الانسحاب بعد ضغوط داخلية وخارجية على الإدارة الأمريكية، حيث خسرت الولايات المتحدة خلال احتلالها للعراق 4474 قتيلاً و 33 ألف جريح حسب الأرقام الرسمية، كما أنفقت حوالي تريليون دولار. من جهة أخرى، عانى العراق من تبعات هذا الانسحاب سياسيًا وأمنيًا. وقد شهدت بغداد عددًا كبيرًا من التفجيرات التي تلت هذا الانسحاب، نتيجة الخروقات الأمنية.\n\nالتسمية\nتجمع المصادر التاريخية أن الخليفة العباسي الثاني أبوجعفر المنصور قد قرر بناء عاصمة له تليق بمكانة الدولة الإسلامية المتصاعدة، فاختار بعد تدقيق وتمحيص موقعًا على نهر الصرا بين نهري دجلة والفرات، حيث كانت تقوم قرية تسمى بغداد. كان يجتمع فيها تجار البلاد في رأس كل شهر. وتجمع المصادر على أن اسم القرية الأصلية في ذلك الموقع هو (بغداذ) و (بغدان) أو تبدل الباء ميمًا فيصير الاسم (مغداد) أو (مغدان). وهذه الأسماء كلها ممنوعة من الصرف ولكنها تقبل التذكير والتأنيث، فتقول (هذا بغداد) و (هذه بغداد). ويشتق منها الفعل «تبغدد» أو «تبغدن» بمعنى سكن بغداد أو تشبه بأهلها.\nوسماها بانيها أبوجعفر المنصور (مدينة السلام) وهو الاسم الرسمي الذي ظهر في وثائق الدواوين العباسية وعلى النقود والأوزان. كما أطلقت على المدينة أسماء أخرى مثل (دار السلام) و (مدينة المنصور) و (مدينة الخلفاء) و (المدينة المدورة) و (عاصمة الرشيد) و (الزوراء). ولكن الاسم القديم (بغداد) هو الذي ظل عالقًا في أذهان الناس ويتردد على ألسنتهم، فأحتفظت المدينة بذلك الاسم حتى يومنا هذا.\nالمعنى الفارسي لاسم مدينة بغداد\nكانت اللغة الفارسية هي اللغة الرسمية والمعتمدة في العراق منذ سقوط الدولة البابلية عام 539 ق.م إلى مجيئ الفتح الإسلامي باستثناء فترات قصيرة خضع فيها العراق لاحتلال الأغريق ثم الرومان. وكانت قرية بغداد الأصلية قائمة أثناء الحكم الساساني للعراق. وهكذا جاء أقدم المؤرخين الذين تطرقوا إلى اسم مدينة بغداد مثل المقدسي وابن رستة بتفسيرات مستمدة من اللغة الفارسية لاسم بغداد. وقد ترددت تلك التفسيرات في كتب المؤرخين اللاحقين. وأكثر هذه التفسيرات شيوعا هو القائل إن (باغ) تعني بستان بالفارسية و (داد) تعني عطية، فيكون معنى الاسم (البستان العطية)، أو (باغ) اسم صنم أو شيطان و (داد) عطية أو هبة فيكون المعنى (عطية الصنم). وقد قرب بعض المعاصرين المعنى فقال أنها تعني (هبة الله). فلا غرابة في أن البكري (ت 487 هجري) قد ضمن اسم بغداد في مصنفه المعروف باسم معجم ما استعجم لأنه عد الاسم أعجميا وأردفه بمعناه العربي.\nالمعنى السومري والأكدي لاسم مدينة بغداد\nكشفت الحفريات الآثارية في موقع بغداد عن واجهة كبيرة مبنية بالآجر البابلي وعليها اسم الملك البابلي الشهير نبوخذنصر (605 - 562 ق.م) وألقابه. من ناحية أخرى، وجدت وثائق بابلية تحمل اسم بلدة (بغداد) تعود إحداها، وهي وثيقة قضائية إلى أيام الملك البابلي حمورابي (1792 - 1750 ق.م) صاحب مسلة القوانين البابلية الشهيرة.وهكذا فإن اسم (بغداد) كان قد اُستعمل قبل ألف عام على الأقل من دخول كلمة (باغ) بمعنى الصنم أو الإله_الرب إلى اللغة الآرامية وعند العودة إلى المعجم الذي أصدره الدكتور بهاءالدين الوردي للغة السومرية، نجد أن بغداد تعني (قلعة قبيلة الصقر) أو (هيكل الصقر)  وهذا مايؤيده عالم الآشوريات الفرنسي لابات في معجمه الخاص بالعلامات الأكدية.\nأسماء بغداد الأخرى\nلقد اختلف مؤرخو مدينة بغداد حتى في معنى إسمها العربي الواضح (مدينة السلام). فرأى بعضهم أن المقصود بالسلام هو الله. ويرى بعضهم أن المنصور أسماها مدينة السلام، لأن نهر دجلة يقال له (وادي السلام). ويرى بعضهم الآخر أن المنصور أسماها (مدينة السلام) تفاؤلا في انها ستكون آمنة مطمئنة. فالسلام شرط أساسي لازدهار المدن ورفاهيتها.\nأما مدينة المنصور ومدينة الخلفاء والمدينة المدورة والزوراء فهي أوصاف لبغداد إستخدمها الخاصة والعامة في نعت المدينة. فتسمية (مدينة المنصور) هي تعريف للمدينة بإضافتها إلى بانيها ، وكذلك (مدينة الخلفاء) تعريفٌ لها بإضافتها إلى ساكنيها بعد تعاقب عدد من الخلفاء العباسيين على الإقامة فيها. و (المدينة المدورة) نعت للمدينة يميزها عن غيرها من المدن، ظنًا من الناعتين بأنها المدينة الوحيدة التي بنيت على شكل دائرة. و (الزوراء) نعت كذلك، اُطلق عليها لأن الأبواب الداخلية لأسوارها مزورة عن الأبواب الخارجية، أي ليست على سمتها كما يقول ياقوت الحموي. ويستخدم ترتيب مداخل أبواب السور على هذا الشكل المنحني أو المنكسر لأغراض دفاعية. ومن المحتمل أن هذه الطريقة قد أستخدمت أول مرة في بغداد  كما اورد الحميري (ت 900 هجرية) في كتابه (الروض المعطار في خبر الأقطار) حين قال: وكان بعضهم يسميها (الصيادة) لأنها تصيد القلوب.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بغداد على خط عرض 33 وخط طول 44 على نهر دجلة، في المنطقة الوسطية للعراق، حيث تقع ما بين المدن الرئيسية شمالاً وجنوبًا، فتبعد عنها البصرة 445 كم إلى الجنوب، بينما تقع شمالاً كل من الموصل على بعد 350 كم وأربيل على بعد 320 كم.\nأما عن مدن الجوار، فيقع إلى الغرب كل من دمشق على بعد 750 كم، عمّان على بعد 800 كم، بيروت على بعد 830 كم، القدس على بعد 875 كم والقاهرة على بعد 1290 كم. وتقع جنوبا كل من الكويت على بعد 545 كم والرياض على بعد 980 كم. أما من الشرق فتقع طهران على بعد 700 كم، وإلى الشمال الغربي تقع أنقرة على بعد 1250 كم.\n\nالموقع والطبوغرافيا\nتقع مدينة بغداد على بعد 85 كم شمال موقع مدينة بابل الأثرية، وعلى بعد بضعة كيلومترات شمال غرب مدينة قطسيفون (المدائن) والتي استمرت كمركز رئيسي للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في أوائل العصر العباسي. في 30 تموز 762 كلٌف الخليفة المنصور ببناء المدينة، وكان البناء تحت إشراف البرامكة. اعتقد المنصور أن بغداد ستكون المدينة المثالية لتكون عاصمة للإمبراطورية الإسلامية تحت حكم العباسيين. اختار أبو جعفر بنفسه رقعة مرتفعة من الأرض، على الجانب الغربي من دجلة عند مصب نهر الرفيل فيه، وقرر أن يشيّد عاصمته الجديدة على هذه الرقعة.\n\nتُعد بغداد أكبر مدن العراق وأيضًا من كبريات مدن الشرق الأوسط وثاني أكبر مدينة عربية معاصرة بعد القاهرة في مصر. ومدينة بغداد من المدن التي ترتبط بتاريخ الخلافة العباسية إن لم يكن تاريخ العالم الإسلامي خلال القرون الخمسة من عام 150 هـ/767م إلى 656 هـ/1258م، فكان أبو جعفر المنصور ثاني خليفة عباسي وأول من اتخذ بغداد عاصمة له بعدما قضى على منافسيه من العباسيين والعلويين في عام 145 هـ 762م، وبنى أبو جعفر المنصور على نهر دجلة عاصمته بغداد في عام (145 - 149 هـ) 710 ميلادية على شكل دائري، وهو اتجاه جديد في بناء المدن الإسلامية، لأن مـعظم المدن الإسلامية، كانت إما مستطيلة كالفسطاط، أو مربعة كالقاهرة، أو بيضاوية كصنعاء. ولعل السبب في ذلك يرجع إلى أن هذه المدن نشأت بجوار مرتفعات حالت دون استدارتها. ويُعتبر تخطيط المدينة المدورة (بغداد)، ظاهرة جديدة في الفن المعماري الإسلامي ولا سيما في المدن الأخرى التي شيّدها العباسيون مثل مدينة سامراء وما حَوته من مساجد وقصور خلافية فخمة. وإلى جانب العمارة وجدت الزخرفة التي وصفت بأنهما لغة الفن الإسلامي، وتقوم على زخرفة المساجد والقصور والقباب بأشكال هندسية أو نباتية جميلة تبعث في النفس الراحة والهدوء والانشراح. وسُمي هذا الفن الزخرفي الإسلامي في أوروبا باسم أرابسك.\n\nتمثل بغداد حاليًا حالة من حالات التتابع المدني في إطار موقع واحد ففي إطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمة إلى سلوقية الإغريقية وقطيسنون الفارسية التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى ثم بغداد العربية الحالية. لا تزال نواة بغداد القديمة موجودة حتى الآن تنتشر حولها الأجزاء الحديثة حول البوابات الشمالية والجنوبية القديمة على الجانب الغربي لنهر دجلة على بعد 540 كم تقريبًا إلى الشمال الغربي من الخليج العربي.\nوتكمن أهمية موقع بغداد في توافر المياه وتناقص أخطار الفيضانات مما أدّى بدوره إلى اتساع رقعة المدينة وزيادة نفوذها إلى جانب سهولة اتصالها عبر دجلة بواسطة الجسور التي تربطها بالجانب الأيسر من النهر .\n\nاتجاه القبلة\nاتجاه القِبلة: 160° درجة من الشمال إلى الغرب (جنوب الغرب).\nالمسافة ما بين مكة وبغداد: 1399 كم\n\nمناطق بغداد\nينقسم مركز العاصمة إلى صوبَيْن (جانبين) هما الكرخ على الجانب الغربي لنهر دجلة، والرصافة على الجانب الشرقي للنهر وفي كلا الجزئين نجد المباني الحديثة وعلى جانب الرصافة توجد منطقة الكرادة ذات الشوارع الضيقة والمحلات الكثيرة ويقصدها معظم سكان بغداد للتبضع، إنّ بعض أسماء مناطق بغداد هي قديمة من تراث بغداد كسبع أبكار، وقد ذُكر تفسير معانيها في كتب وبعض أسماءها حديثة كحي الخضراء، وفي عام 1908م اتخذت الحكومة العثمانية أسماءً جديدةً لمحلات بغداد وشوارعها. وفي تشرين الأول عام 2000، أُعلنَ في بغداد عن مبادرة حكومية لتغيير بعض أسماء مناطق بغداد وشوارعها تنفيذاً لمقاصد «حملة الانسجام بين المكان والحاضر والماضي»، ومن ذلك تغييرُ شارع كورنيش الأعظمية من اسم شارع بيرم التونسي إلى شارع امرؤ القيس إذ رأت لجنة الأسماء أن شارع الكورنيش يتوافق مع الرومانسية المعهودة من امرؤ القيس، وذكر مسؤول اللجنة أن الأسماء «بعضها لا ينسجم مع الذوق العام لأنها استمدت أسمائها من حادث أو شخصية»، وبيّنَ أن مقياس الاختيار ليس بشهرة الاسم في مكانه بل يُنتقى «من التاريخ العربي والعراقي القديم والمعاصر»، وقال إن بعض المناطق لم تكن لها أسماء فاختاروا لها تسمية، وأقرّ بوجود أسماء رسمية لا يعرفها الناس بسبب تجاهل الدوائر الحكومية لاستعمال تلك الأسماء. وفي 1 حزيران عام 2017 أعلنَ مجلس محافظة بغداد عن تغيير اسم شارع ابن تيمية في جنوب الوزيرية إلى شارع الشافعي. الجدول التالي يبين ببعض مناطق بغداد الرئيسية:\n\nالمناطق الصناعية في بغداد\nتمتد المناطق الصناعية من مركز بغداد إلى خارجها وضواحيها مثل الحي الصناعي في البياع، ومنطقة التاجي الصناعية شمال المدينة.\n\nالمناخ\nيُعتبر مناخ بغداد مناخ صحراوي، حيث يتميز الصيف في العراق بارتفاع درجات الحرارة. وقد لازم ارتفاع درجات الحرارة في بغداد خلال السنوات الأخيرة ظاهرة هبوب العواصف الترابية الخفيفة. ويعلل الخبراء شدة هذه الظواهر في صيف بغداد بعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003، إلى الإحتباس الذي يعانيه الجو في البلاد وازدياد نسبة الكربون في الجو نتيجة عوادم المولدات الكهربائية، وازدياد ظاهرة التصحر، وانجراف التربة، والجفاف، وتغيير البيئة العراقية ككل نتيجة الإهمال المتعمد وعدم وضع الحلول العاجلة.\nوتوجد في محافظة بغداد محطة رصد جوي واقعة في مطار بغداد الدولي، تأسست منذ تأسيس المطار. وتعمل على الرصد السطحي وذلك بنقل الحالة السائدة على أرض المطار كل ساعة إلى قسم التنبؤ الجوي وقسم الرقابة الجوية في المطار.\n\nالسكان\nتُعتبر بغداد في الوقت الحاضر أكبر مدن العراق، حيث يسكن محافظة بغداد قرابة 7.2 مليون نسمة. فيما بلغ عدد سكان المحافظة عام 2009 قرابة 6.7 مليون نسمة. كما تُعتبر ثاني كبريات العواصم العربية من حيث حجمها السكاني. ويتكون معظم سكان مدينة بغداد من العرب المسلمين والأكراد الفيليين وأقليات من المسيحيين والصابئة واليزيديين، فيما كان اليهود قبل عام 1948م، يشكلون نسبة كبيرة من السكان وكانوا أكبر طائفة غير مسلمة لكن عددهم تناقص بشكل حاد بعد إعلان نشوء دولة إسرائيل على أرض فلسطين وهجرتهم الجماعية نهاية الأربعينيات وبداية الخمسينيات.\nلقد قفزت نسبة سكان بغداد إلى مجموع سكان عموم العراق بشكل كبير جداً في خلال بضعة عقود من الزمن. كما انعكست تلك الزيادة الكبيرة في عدد السكان في اكتظاظ سكاني خانق في العديد من مناطق بغداد السكنية وعلى الخصوص في مركز مدينة بغداد. وقد تجاوزت الكثافة السكانية لمدينة الثورة (مدينة الصدر) أعلى معدلات الكثافة السكانية المسجلة في المنطقة. تزامنت تلك الظاهرة السريعة مع فترة اضطرابات غير مسبوقة في تاريخ العراق الحديث، فقد تفجرت أزمة سكن حادة في بغداد، وبدأت تظهر اختناقات مرورية، وعجز واسع النطاق في الخدمات الأساسية لحياة المواطنين البغداديين كالنقص في تجهيز مياه الشرب والنقص في تجهيزات الطاقة وخدمات الاتصالات.\nالجدول الآتي يظهر عدد سكان مدينة بغداد التقريبي من عام 1800 وحتى 2010:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمن الناحية الاقتصادية، تُعد بغداد مركزًا للعديد من المصانع والورش، والمركز الرئيسي للصناعة في العراق كما تعد مركزًا تجاريًّا رئيسيًّا وحلقة وصل بين تركيا وسوريا والهند وجنوب شرق آسيا والسوق التجاري الرئيسي في الدولة وأيضًا تعد مركزاً سياحياً هاماً يزوره أكثر من مليون سائح في السنة قبل الحصار حيث كان المطار الدولي يعمل وتُعد أيضًا بغداد من المناطق الزراعية حيث إن كثيرا من توابعها يعتمد على زراعة كثير من الغلات.\n\nالصناعة\nيُعد كل من السجاد والجلود والمنسوجات ومنتجات الإسمنت والتبغ، أهم المنتجات في بغداد. كما يُعتبر إنتاج وتكرير النفط أيضًا أحد أهم الأنشطة الاقتصادية في المدينة. حيث ثبت أن حقل نفط شرق بغداد يحمل أحد أكبر الاحتياطيات في العراق (18 بليون برميل). وتُعتبر مصفاة الدورة التي تقع على مشارف المدينة هي ثالث أكبر مصفاة في العراق من حيث القدرة على الإنتاج (100,000 برميل باليوم الواحد). يُشار بالذكر إلى أن بغداد تحتضن سنويًّا معرضًا عالميًا لمختلف الصناعات حول العالم، هو معرض بغداد الدولي.\n\nالزراعة\nتنتشر في المدينة بساتين النخيل، وتتركز بكثافة على ضفاف نهر دجلة. وتُعتبر الوثائق العثمانية وخصوصا سندات الطابو واحدة من أهم المصادر التاريخية التي توثق ذلك، لما لها من أهمية بعد إصدار الدولة العثمانية لقانون الأراضي عام 1859. حيث تشير هذه الوثائق إلى أن بساتين النخيل كانت تاريخيا موجودة على ضفتي نهر دجلة، بالإضافة لوجود بساتين أخرى تحوي أشجار مثمرة كالحمضيات، كما تنتج هذه الأراضي محاصيلا وفيرة.\n\nالتجارة\nكان من نتيجة وقوع بغداد تاريخيًا على مسار طريق الحرير العالمي، وفي وسط العراق حديثًا، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني بشكل كبير. ولقد لعبت الأسواق التجارية في المدينة منذ القدم دورا مهما محوريا في الحركة التجارية والاقتصادية. وتشهد أسواق المدينة نشاطا كبيرًا على مدار العام وتعرض فيها سلع ومنتجات محلية أو مستوردة من مناشئ مختلفة.\nوتختلف هذه الأسواق من حيث التراث والحداثة أو حسب نوعية السلع التي تتعامل فيها، فمنها ما يُعتبر من الأسواق التراثية، كسوق الصفافير وسوق السراي، وسوق الساعاتية، وسوق الاسترابادي، وسوق المستنصر، وسوق دانيال، ومنها ما هو أسواق للجملة، ويتركز هذا النوع في سوقين رئيسيين هما سوق جميلة، وسوق الشورجة. بالإضافة إلى الخانات القديمة. كما تحوي المدينة على الكثير من الأسواق الجديدة كالسوق العربي، وسوق الأرمن، وسوق الكنيسة، والسوق العباسي. هذا بالإضافة إلى المجمعات التجارية الحديثة، حيث ظهرت في السبعينيات والثمانينات من القرن العشرين الأسواق المركزية في عدد من المناطق البغدادية. أما اليوم فيوجد عدد من مراكز التسوق الكبيرة نسبيًا في بعض الأماكن التجارية من العاصمة.\n\nبغداد الرسمية\nتحوي المدينة على مراكز الحكم الرئيسية في البلاد، بالإضافة إلى الوزارت والسفارات الأجنبية ومقرات المنظمات الدولية العاملة في العراق. كما توجد في بغداد أهم القصور الرئاسية التي يعود تاريخها إلى فترات مختلفة، منها القصر الجمهوري، وقصر الفاو، قصر الرحاب، قصر الزهور، وقصر السلام. وتُعد منطقة كرادة مريم (المنطقة الخضراء بعد 2003) أهم المناطق التي تقع فيها هذه المؤسسات الإدارية.\n\nأمانة بغداد\nيعود تاريخ تأسيس أمانة بغداد إلى زمن الدولة العثمانية في عهد الوالي مدحت باشا عام 1868، حيث كانت بمستوى بلدية. وجاءت تسمية أمانة العاصمة وتسمية رئيسها بـ «أمين العاصمة» بعد صدور قانون إدارة البلدية عام 1931. وبموجبه تم إلغاء قانون البلديات العثماني السابق وجميع الأنظمة والتعليمات الصادرة بموجبه. لقد كان ارتباط أمانة العاصمة بوزارة الداخلية حتى قيام ثورة 14 تموز عام 1958. في عام 1987، تم تغيير تسمية «أمانة العاصمة» إلى «أمانة بغداد»، كذلك تم إلغاء محافظة بغداد وجعلها مدينة بغداد بعد أن تم تعديل ارتباط الوحدات الإدارية التابعة لها ووضعت حدود جديدة لمدينة بغداد وأُعيد ارتباط الأمانة بمجلس الوزراء وهو الحال القائم حاليًا. إلا أن إعادة المحافظة قد تم في وقت لاحق.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nتتكون بغداد من شبكة من الخطوط السريعة والطرق الرئيسية والثانوية تغطي جميع أنحاء المدينة. وترتبط بمطار بغداد الدولي عبر طريق سريع يمتد إلى الجهة الغربية منها. كما ترتبط بمدن العراق الأخرى وبمدن الجوار عبر عدد من الطرق السريعة، أهمها طريق المرور السريع 1 الذي يربط عدد من الدول العربية مرورًا ببغداد، فضلاً عن الطريق الاستراتيجي الممتد من مدينة زاخو في الشمال إلى محافظة البصرة مروراً ببغداد. وتُعد الطرق التالية من أهم وأشهر الشوارع الرئيسية الداخلية في المدينة: 14 رمضان، وأبو نؤاس، والمتنبي، والمغرب، والأميرات، والرشيد، والفضل، والنضال، وحيفا، وعمر بن عبد العزيز، وفلسطين، وغيرها. كما يمر بالمدينة عدد من السكك الحديدية التي تربط شمال العراق بجنوبه، فهناك خط سكك حديد بغداد – الموصل، وخط سكك حديد بغداد – البصرة.\nوقد تأثرت البنية التحتية في بغداد أسوةً بباقي مدن وقرى العراق، بشكل كبير نتيجة للحروب التي خاضتها البلاد في العقود الأخيرة، والحصار الإقتصادي الذي فُرض عليه لمدة 13 عام. ثم تلى ذلك الغزو الأمريكي للعراق في عام 2003، والإدارة السيئة للموارد بعده، واللذان أثرا سلبا بشكل كبير على ما تبقى من بنية تحتية.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nازداد الازدحام في مدينة بغداد، ولا سيما بعد الاحتلال الأمريكي سنة 2003، حين تكاثر استيراد السيارات، قال عضو مجلس النواب، جاسمُ البخاتي، في يوم 16 آذار سنة 2021 «إن طرق بغداد مصممة لاستيعاب 700 ألف سيارة، بينما يتجول فيها الآن ما بين 2.5 و 3 ملايين سيارة»، تُعتبر الحافلات والمركبات الصغيرة الوسائل الرئيسية للتنقل داخل مدينة بغداد. ويوجد من هذه الحافلات ما هو عام تابع للمنشأة العامة للنقل، ومنها ماهو خاص. أما بالنسبة للمركبات فتُستخدم سيارات الأجرة والسيارات الخاصة.\nكما يُعد النقل النهري عبر نهر دجلة من الوسائل الشائعة أيضًا لدى البغداديين، حيث تختصر القوارب الكثير من الوقت والمسافات، خاصة بعد الوضع الأمني السيئ الذي تلى الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003، والذي نتج عنه إغلاق عدد كبير من الطرق والجسور الرئيسية في المدينة، ووضع نقاط تفتيش وجدارن كونكريتية حالت دون وصول المواطنين إلى العديد من الأماكن عبر المركبات بصورة طبيعية، وأدت إلى اختناقات مرورية كبيرة. ويُسمح لهذه القوارب التنقل بين عدد قليل من جسور بغداد البالغ عددها 13 جسرًا.\nوكان من المفترض إنشاء مشروع مترو في المدينة منذ عدة عقود، كما كانت هناك خطط لبناء هذا النظام. وقد بُنيَ فعلا جزء من الأنفاق، ولكنها أستخدمت لأغراض عسكرية. بدأت الحكومة العراقية في تشرين الثاني / نوفمبر 2008 بدراسات الجدوى لبناء خطين تحت الأرض في كل من بغداد والنجف جنوب البلاد، إلا أن المشروع لم يرَ النور إلى الآن.\n\nسكك الحديد\n\nشهد العراق أول خط حديدي لعربات الترام عام 1869، عندما أسس الوالي العثماني مدحت باشا شركة ترامواي بغداد - الكاظمية، حيث استخدمت الخيول لجر العربات، وكان يعرف لدى العراقيون ب «الكاري». وقد تشكلت أول إدارة للسكك الحديد في العراق في عام 1916، وكانت آنذاك تحت سيطرة الجيش البريطاني. ثم انتقلت إلى إدارة مدنية بريطانية عام 1920، ثم تحولت إلى إدارة مدنية عراقية في 1936. وقد تم تسيير أول رحلة من بغداد إلى سميكة الدجيل الواقعة إلى الجنوب من مدينة سامراء عام 1914.\nتقوم الشركة العامة لسكك الحديد حاليا بتسيير رحلات للقطار بين بغداد والبصرة، حيث سُير أول قطار بينهما عام 1920. في حين أنه قد تم تسيير أول قطار بين بغداد وكركوك عام 1925، وأول قطار بين بغداد والموصل عام 1940، وأول قطار من العراق إلى محطة حيدر باشا في إسطنبول في 15 تموز عام 1940. وقد تم تشغيل أول قطار على الخط القياسي في العراق بين بغداد والبصرة عام 1967.\nتضرر قطاع سكك الحديد في العراق بفعل الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003 وما أعقبه من عمليات نهب، حيث لم يعد صالحًا للاستخدام من القاطرات سوى عدد قليل. كما أن الوضع الأمني غير المستقر أدى إلى توقف الرحلات بشكل نهائي في فترات معينة.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nتميز النمط المعماري البغدادي بتناغم متناسق بين الناحية الوظيفية والناحية الجمالية. وقد راعى المعمار العراقي عند تشييد الدار البغدادي الظروف المناخية وأحياءها ومحلاتها، وجعل النوافذ المطلة على الخارج قليلة الفتحات ومقاربة لنوافذ الجانب الآخر من الدور، وجعل الفسحات المكشوفة متجهة لوسط الدار ليوفر بذلك جوًا مظللاً منورًا قد الإمكان مراعيًا الظروف الاجتماعية السائدة حينذاك. وقد أكثر المعمار البغدادي من استخدام الخشب للحد من تقلبات درجة الحرارة في داخل الدار.\nكان الطابوق ولا يزال يُعتبر المادة الأساسية في بناء العمارة البغدادية لعدم توفر الحجر كما في بلاد الشام، كما استخدام الآجر في صياغة أنواع من العقود المستديرة والمدببة والتي كونت مع الطابوق مقرنصات جمعت بين الوظيفة الانشائية وجمالية التشكيل. أما الأسقف التي اُقيمت على الأعمدة فكانت مادتها الاساسية الخشب.\nمن الجدير بالذكر أن بغداد شهدت في نهاية العشرينات من القرن العشرين نمطًا انتقاليًا بين النمط البغدادي القديم والنمط الذي ساد فيما بعد، والمتمثل بتشييد «محلة السنك»، والتي استخدم في تشييدها نمط جديد تمثل في استخدام حديد الشيلمان في تسقيف الدور والمحلات العامة والخانات للأغراض التجارية، كما ظهرت سينما الرشيد والحمراء وعلاء الدين.\nتمتاز أزقة بغداد وأماكنها السكنية القديمة كشارع الرشيد بعناصر معمارية مميزة، أهمها الشناشيل (المشربيات)، التي كانت أبرز معالمها. وتكتسب الشناشيل، أو النوافذ الخشبية المحفورة أو المزخرفة، أهمية اجتماعية لدى البغداديين، من حيث ضمان الخصوصية في المنزل، فضلاً عن تخفيفها حدة أشعة الشمس وتلطيف الهواء، كما أن بعضها مغطى بالزجاج إتقاءاً لبرودة الشتاء. كما تنتشر البيوت التراثية القديمة على مساحة وسعة من العاصمة، كما في شارع الكفاح وشارع الشيخ عمر والخلفاء والبتاويين والكاظمية والأعظمية والشواكة والكريمات.\n\nعمارة الحداثة\nمرّت مدينة بغداد بتغيرات وتطورت مختلفة، أثرت على طابعها العمراني بشكل ملحوظ. وغير ذلك من نسيجها الحضري. وكان من أبرز التغيرات في عمارتها تلك الفترة التي تميزت ببزوغ وانتشار عمارة الحداثة. فهي تمثل القترة بين الأربعينيات والسبعينيات من القرن العشرين والتي كان لها أسبابها العديدة وعواملها المختلفة التي مهدت لانتشار عمارة الحداثة. وقد تأسس في بغداد عام 1950 مجلس الإعمار العراقي، الذي نفذ وخطط للعديد من المشاريع الحيوية التي ما زالت قائمة وفعالة إلى اليوم.\nشهدت حقبة الخمسينات وما بعدها نموًا واسعًا لفكر الحداثة في المجال المعماري. وقد برزت أسماء بغدادية كبيرة في فن العمارة والنحت مثل رفعت الجادرجي، محمد صالح مكية، جواد سليم، خالد الرحال، محمد غني حكمت، زها حديد، وغيرهم. كما تمّت دعوة معماريين عالميين كبار لتصميم أبنية في بغداد، ومن هؤلاء المعماريين جيو بونتي وفرانك لويد رايت وألفار ألتو ووليم دودوك، ووالتر غروبيوس الذي صمّم ابنية جامعة بغداد، بالإضافة إلى فيرني مارج الذي صمّم المتحف العراقي الوطني، والذي جمع في تصميمه ثقافة بلاد الرافدين مع بناء حديث. غير أن العديد من هذه المشاريع تأجل تنفيذها لعقود أو أنها لم تُنفذ بتاتًا، كما هو الحال مع مشروع المدينة الأولمبية الذي دعي لتصميمه المعماري لي كوربوزيه في العام 1956. ومن هذه المدينة لم يتم تنفيذ سوى قاعة الألعاب الرياضية خلال الثمانينات وذلك بإشراف إحدى المؤسسات الفرنسية وبتطابق تام مع التصميم الأصلي.\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nشهدت مدينة بغداد مراحل متعددة في نموها وتطورها كانت استجابة للمتغيرات العمرانية والتخطيطية والاقتصادية والاجتماعية والسياسية، مما انعكس على نسيجها واستعمالات الأرض فيها. وقد اتسمت بغداد في عشرينيات القرن العشرين بالنسيج المتضام العفوي والتدرج الهرمي للشوارع والأزقة التي تنتهي بطرق غير نافذة، وكانت استعمالات الأرض متداخلة فيما بينها، وكان الطابع السكني هو الغالب على المدينة مع وجود المناطق التجارية في المركز. وقد تحولت المدينة في الفترة الممتدة من الثلاثينات وحتى نهاية الخمسينيات من النمو شبه الدائري إلى الامتداد الطولي على محور نهر دجلة، كما بدأ النظام الشبكي للشوارع بالظهور.\nلقد وصلت مدينة بغداد إلى مرحلة النضج العمراني والتخطيطي في الفترة الممتدة من الستينات وحتى أواخر السبعينات. وتوسعت المدينة بنمطين، الأول طولي على امتداد الطرق لرئيسية، والثاني حول نوى وظيفية ومعمارية كالأسواق والجوامع أو تقاطعات الطرق.\nلقد تم وضع أول مخطط هيكلي لمدينة بغداد في عام 1956، وهو «مخطط مينوبريو، سبنسمي وماكفارليف» من المملكة المتحدة، حيث يتألف من شبكة للطرق الرئسية ومبان عامة جديدة وتصاميم معمارية للمراكز الحكومية مع تخصيص منطقة صناعية جنوب بغداد. ولكن المخطط لم يُنفذ، حيث لم يتثمر نهر دجلة، ولم تدرس فيه بدقة واقع المجتمع البغدادي وأهمية الحفاظ على تراثه. لذا تم العمل على مخطط آخر هو «مخطط دوكسيادس» من اليونان في عام 1959. حيث كان مستطيلا مكون من شبكة تخطيطية.\nومع حلول السبعينيات، ظهرت فكرة تطوير «منطقة بغداد الكبرى»، وذلك عندما أوصى التصميم الإنمائي الشامل لعام 1973 بأن يتم إعداد تصميم العاصمة الأساسي في إطار خطة التنمية القومية، وإن فائض عدد سكان العاصمة على قابلية الإستيعاب المقررة المتأتي من الهجرة ومن الزيادة الطبيعية لنمو السكان يتوجب توطينهم في منطقة بغداد الكبرى التي حددها التصميم الانمائى الشامل بدائرة نصف قطرها يتراوح ما بين 50 - 55 كم من مركز بغداد، وهذه الدائرة أيضًا تحاط بمنطقه دائرة الإقليم المركزي ذو نصف القطر البالغ بما بمقداره من 100 - 120 كم من مركز العاصمة.\n\nدور العبادة\nينتشر في مدينة بغداد الآف المساجد والحسينيات للمذاهب الإسلامية المختلفة، كثير منها تم تصميمه على عمارة إسلامية. وتحوي المدينة على الكثير من المساجد الأثرية من العهد العباسي وحتى العثماني مثل جامع الخلفاء من عام 908، وجامع مرجان من عام 1356، وجامع سيد سلطان علي من عام 1589، جامع حسين باشا من عام 1674، وجامع العادلية من عام 1749، وجامع الحيدرخانة من عام 1819، وجامع الأزبك من عام 1879، وجامع الشيخ معروف الكرخي من عام 1892. كما يوجد في المدينة عدد من المساجد الكبرى والمراقد التي لها أهمية تاريخية، مثل مسجد الإمام الأعظم (مرقد الإمام أبو حنيفة النعمان) المؤسس عام 985، ومسجد الحضرة الكاظمية (مرقد الإمام موسى الكاظم) المؤسس عام 947. وجامع الشيخ عبد القادر الكيلاني في الحضرة القادرية منذ عام 1534م.\nلقد ازدادت مساجد المدينة بشكل ملحوظ بعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003. وكانت من بين مظاهر الفوضى التي خلفتها الحرب، الانتشار العشوائي للجوامع والمساجد التي بنيت بالتجاوز على أراض مملوكة للغير أو حوٌلت مبان حكومية متروكة إلى مساجد دون الحصول على الموافقات الرسمية اللازمة.\nتنتشر في المدينة عشرات الكنائس للطوائف المسيحية المختلفة في مختلف أنحائها، حيث تواجدت الطائفة المسيحية في بغداد منذ انشائها في العصر العباسي. بل يُرجع بعض المؤرخون تواجد المسيحية في موقع مدينة بغداد الحالي إلى ما قبل إنشاء مدينة بغداد على يد الخليفة أبو جعفر المنصور، حيث أشار بعض المؤرخون إلى وجود أديرة مسيحية قديمة في أطراف موقع بغداد الحالي. وتضم بغداد على أكبر تجمع مسيحي في العراق، ويتألف المسيحيون في بغداد من عدة طوائف غالبيتهم من الكلدان والسريان الكاثوليك لكن يوجد تجمع كبير للكنائس الآشورية المشرقية والسريانية الأرثوذكسية مع تواجد أكبر تجمع بروتستانتي في العراق في بغداد.\nتضم بغداد بالإضافة لعدد من دور العبادة التابعة للصابئة المندائيين. ويوجد في المدينة أيضًا كنيس يهودي في منطقة البتاوين، لكنه مهجور بسبب تهجير يهود العراق إلى فلسطين في نهاية الأربعينيات وبداية الخمسينيات من القرن العشرين. يُشار بالذكر إلى أن أعمال العنف الذي شهدته البلاد وهجرة المسيحيين بكثرة مؤخرًا، أديّا إلى إغلاق كثير من الكنائس في بغداد.\n\nمعالم بغداد\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتأسست في بغداد منذ إنشائها في القرن الثامن، عدة مدارس تاريخية كان لها دور كبير في الحضارة الإسلامية، منها المدرسة المأمونية، المدرسة المستنصرية، المدرسة الموفقية، المدرسة النظامية، ومدرسة محمد امين السويدي. وتُعتبر بغداد تاريخيّا، المركز التعليمي الرئيس في العراق. كما كانت الحكومة العراقية في الفترة المعاصرة هي المسؤولة عن هذا القطاع لفترة طويلة.\n\nلقد عانى قطاع التعليم والتعليم العالي في بغداد ابتداءً من حرب الخليج الأولى (1980 - 1988)، وحتى الغزو الأمريكي للعراق في عام 2003، الذي استمرت تبعاته إلى اليوم، حيث تعرضت الكثير من المنشآت التعليمية للقصف أو التفجيرات طيلة العقود القليلة الماضية. وقد تدهور التعليم في العراق بشكل عام في الفترة الأخيرة، مما أدى لظهور التعليم الخاص بموازاة التعليم الحكومي، بالإضافة لزيادة كبيرة في نسبة الأمية نتيجة للتهرب من المدارس.\nالتعليم الأساسي والإعدادي\nشهدت الفترة المتأخرة من العهد العثماني في بغداد نهضة تعليمية. فقد أنشأ الوالي مدحت باشا أول مدارس بغداد المعاصرة، وهي المدرسة الرشدية العسكرية سنة 1869، التي تخرج منها ضباطا عراقيين بعد دراسة 4 سنوات. كما تأسست أول مدارس المدينة الإعدادية عام 1888، وهي الإعدادية المركزية، وكانت الثانوية الوحيدة في المدينة. وتُعد أول مؤسسة علمية وثقافية معاصرة في بغداد وارتبط اسمها بتأريخ المدينة وذاكرتها الثقافية. أما في عام 1889، فقد تم تأسيس أول مدرسة ابتدائية حكومية في المدينة أيام الوالي سري باشا، وقد تبرع ببنائها العلامة عبد الوهاب النائب، وأُطلق عليها أسم «حميدية مكتبي». ويوجد في المدينة اليوم عدد كبير من المدارس، بعضها مخصص للطلبة الموهوبين مثل ثانوية المتميزين، وكلية بغداد.\nالتعليم العالي\nبالنسبة للتعليم الجامعي، فتحوي المدينة على خمسة جامعات رئيسية. وقد تأسست أول جامعة في المدينة عام 1957، وهي جامعة بغداد، والتي تأسست كمدرسة للحقوق في بادئ الأمر عام 1908. ثم تلاها الجامعات الأخرى، وهي الجامعة المستنصرية، والجامعة التكنولوجية، وجامعة النهرين والجامعة العراقية تأسست العديد من الكليات الاهلية والتي تكون تحت اشراف وزارة التعليم العالي والبحث العلمي، مثل كلية المنصور الجامعة، وكلية بغداد للصيدلة، وغيرها العديد من الكليات والمعاهد.\n\nالثقافة\nاشتهرت بغداد منذ العصر العباسي بالشعراء والأدباء والكتاب المعروفين، حيث إن الحراك الثقافي بدأ يُبرز المدينة كواحدة من أكثر العواصم العربية تأثيراً في الثقافة والفنون. ويُعقد في بغداد سنويّا العديد من المهرجانات الثقافية كمهرجان بغداد السينمائي الدولي. وتحوي المدينة على عدد كبير من الصروح الثقافية الهامة كالمسرح الوطني العراقي، المتحف العراقي، ومكتبة بيت الحكمة. بالإضافة إلى عدد من المقاهي الثقافية الشهيرة ودور العرض القديمة التي تقع في شارع الرشيد وشارع المتنبي، وغيرها. كما تزخر بغداد اليوم بالعديد من الأسماء الكبيرة في مجالات الفن والأدب والرسم والسينما وغيرهم الكثير من الفنانين.\nوكان الفن البغدادي الحديث قد أنجب في مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن العشرين مجموعة أعمال إبداعية كبيرة ذات سمات جمالية جديدة تميزت بانتمائها الجذري لتاريخ العراق وارتباطها الصريح بتطوره، كما كان لظهور ثورة الشعر الحر في العراق انعكاسًا في ازدهار الوعي الاجتماعي والثقافي في هذه الفترة. وقد أدى هذا إلى تأسيس جماعة بغداد للفن الحديث عام 1951 على يد عدد من رواد الفن العراقي كشاكر حسن آل سعيد وجواد سليم وغيرهم، كما انضم لها نخبة من التشكيليين والمعماريين والفنانين العراقيين فيما بعد.\nأصبحت الجماعة بعد ظهورها مركز إشعاع فكري للفنانين العراقيين في الستينات والسبعينات، كما أسهموا في وضع لبنات جديدة إلى صرح الفن العراقي الحديث المعاصر.\n\nمن جهة أخرى، تم تأسيس المتحف الوطني للفن الحديث (مركز صدام للفنون سابقًا) في بغداد في ثمانينيات القرن العشرين، والذي ضم نخبة من اللوحات الفنية لرواد الحركة التشكيلية المعاصرة في العراق، إلا أنه تعرض للسرقة والإهمال مؤخرًا.\nشهدت البنى التحتية الثقافية في بغداد واقعًا سيئًا بعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003، حيث يتجلى هذا الواقع بنحو خاص في الحال الراهن للمرافق الثقافية. فقد تم إغلاق معظم المتاحف والمكتبات ودور العرض وقاعات الفن التشكيلي في المدينة. في ظل هذه الظروف السيئة، تعد بغداد واحدة من المدن المبدعة في قائمة اليونيسكو للمدن الإبداعية في المجال الأدبي منذ عام 2015م، وتم اختيار بغداد عاصمة للثقافة العربية لعام 2013، وقد شهد هذا العام زخمًا ثقافيًا لم تعهده المدينة منذ عام 2003، حيث اُقيمت عدد من العروض الموسيقية والمسرحية من العراق وبعض الدول العربية، بالإضافة لمعارض الكتاب والفنون التشكيلية وملتقيات شعرية وأدبية أخرى.\nالتراث والفلكلور\n\nتتميز بغداد بإرث حضاري وتراث فني وموسيقي كبيرين، حيث يُعد المقام العراقي من الفنون الموسيقية العربية القديمة، ويعتبره البعض أرقى شكل من أشكال المقام. وتمتاز المدينة بمقام الجالغي البغدادي، والذي يقوم بأداءه قارئ، بالإضافة إلى عدد من العازفين على آلات السنطور، الجوزة، والطبلة أو الدنبك وأحياناً آلة الرق. ويُعتبر الفنان محمد القبانجي من أهم مؤديي هذا الفن في القرن العشرين.\n\nيُعتبر المتحف البغدادي من أهم الصروح الثقافية التي تؤرخ لتراث بغداد في التاريخ المعاصر. وقد عمدت أمانة بغداد على إنشاء هذا المتحف عام 1968 بالقرب من المدرسة المستنصرية ليضم غالبية المعالم الحياتية لسكان بغداد الأوائل، ويوثق بموضوعية فترة زمنية من تأريخ العاصمة. ويضم اليوم بعد التوسعة 385 تمثالاً توزعت على 77 مشهدا. كما قامت محافظة بغداد في عام 2011 بإعادة تأهيل وافتتاح أحد المباني التراثية القديمة في شارع المتنبي كمركز ثقافي بغدادي، والذي يوفر مصادر تراثية عبر مكتبة بغداد، وهي مكتبة تراثية تعنى بتاريخ وتراث هذه المدينة.\nوقد تحدث الكثيرون من الكتاب والمؤرخين عن بغداد القديمة وتأسيسها وتسميتها، ووصفوا تراثها ومميزاته، حيث تميزت المدينة بحرف كثيرة كصناعة النحاسيات (الصفر)، وتعد صناعة الصفر من أقدم الصناعات الشعبية في بغداد والعراق، كما عُرف عن سوق الصفافير أنه قبلة السواح قبل عقود من الزمن، إلا أن السوق في الوقت الحاضر يشهد انحسار كبير بسبب الحروب وأعوام الحصار والوضع الأمني المتدهور، وقطع أجزاء من شارع الرشيد وجعله ممرًا واحدًا.\nبغداد في الشعر والفن\nلبغداد مكانة كبيرة في ذاكرة الشعراء. وقد كُتب عنها الكثير وروي الأكثر، مثلما تركت على مستوى العمارة والبناء والفعلية الحياتية، مايستحق أن يقال عنه الكثير. ولقد تغنى الأدباء ببغداد على طول امتداد عمرها منذ بناها الخليفة أبو جعفر المنصور. الأبيات التالية هي بعض ما عبّر به شعراء عرب في وصف بغداد:\n\nكذلك ورد ذكر المدينة في بعض الأغاني والقصص الفلكلوريَّة المحليَّة والعربية، كما تغنى بها وبمجدها كبار المغنيين والمغنيات العراقيين والعرب، حيث غنت لها أم كلثوم ومحمد عبد الوهاب وفريد الأطرش وفيروز وكاظم الساهر، وغيرهم.\n\nالسياحة\nتمتاز بغداد بعدة معالم سياحية وأثرية مثل المتاحف التي تعرض فيها الآثار المختلفة من جواهر وعملات وهياكل بشرية وتماثيل من عصور ما قبل التاريخ حتى القرن السابع عشر الميلادي. ومن شواهدها الأبدية الآثار الإسلامية التي تتمثل في بقايا سور بغداد ودار الخلافة والمدرسة المستنصرية التي فيها ساعة المدرسة المستنصرية العجيبة ومقر المعتصم ومسجده الشهير وتحتوي على مساجد تاريخية عديدة منها: جامع الخلفاء والذي كان يسمى جامع الخليفة، ومسجد الإمام الأعظم أبو حنيفة في الأعظمية، وجامع الأحمدية والذي فيه مدرسة تاريخية هي مدرسة الأحمدية، ومسجد الإمام موسى الكاظم وفيه الحضرة الكاظمية، وجامع مرجان في سوق الشورجة، وجامع المنصور وجامع المهدي وجامع الرصافة، بالإضافة لمدارس تاريخية عريقة كالمدرسة الشرفية بجوار قبر أبي حنيفة النعمان والمدرسة الموفقية ومدرسة الآصفية، والمدرسة القادرية، والمدرسة النظامية. وتعاني المباني التراثية لبغداد حاليا من الإهمال والتعدي عليها، خاصة بعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003.\nكما تحوي المدينة عدد من المناطق الترفيهية، مثل مدينة ألعاب الرصافة، ومدينة العاب الكرخ، وجزيرة بغداد السياحية، متنزه الزوراء، وجزيرة الأعراس، والخضراء، وغيرها. هذا بالإضافة إلى عدد من النوادي الاجتماعية مثل: نادي الصيد، نادي الفروسية، نادي العلوية، ونادي الهندية، ونادي المنصور .\n\nالرياضة\nيوجد في بغداد عدد من ملاعب كرة القدم القديمة، وعدد من الصالات الرياضية المُغلقة، التي صمم إحداها المعمار العالمي لي كوربوزيه. وقد تم إنشاء أول ملاعب المدينة في عام 1966، بعد أن وُضع حجر الأساس في عهد الزعيم عبد الكريم قاسم، حيث يتسع الملعب لخمسين ألف متفرج. وهو أكبر ملاعب المدينة إلى هذا اليوم. ومن الملاعب الأخرى في المدينة ملعب الجيش، ملعب الزوراء، وملعب القوة الجوية. كما تحوي كلية التربية الرياضية على عدد من المنشآت الرياضية الكبيرة داخل حرم جامعة بغداد.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أن العمل جارِ على تنفيذ مدينة رياضية في منطقة التاجي شمال بغداد، تبلغ مساحتها مايقارب 500 دونم، وتشمل الملعب الأولمبي الرئيسي الذي يتسع لستين ألف متفرج، وثلاثة ملاعب للتدريب، اثنان منها في الجانبين الجنوبي والشمالي من الموقع سعة كل واحد منهما 500 متفرج والثالث يتسع لـ 5000 متفرج.\nلقد عانى القطاع الرياضي في العراق من الإهمال والعقوبات الدولية بعد الحروب المتتالية التي شهدتها البلاد، وخصوصا الغزو الأمريكي للعراق. وقد كان للمنتخب العراقي لكرة القدم أول مبارياته الدولية على أرضه منذ 2003 مع نظيره الفلسطيني في مدينتيّ بغداد وأربيل عام 2009، حيث شكل هذا الحدث، مؤشرًا هامًا لعودة الحياة الطبيعية إلى العراق.\n\nالصحة\nتأسس في بغداد عام 1973 أحد أكبر الصروح الطبية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط، وهو مدينة الطب، حيث تضم بين دفتيها خمسة مستشفيات كبرى، هي دار التمريض الخاص، والجراحات التخصصية، وأمراض الجهاز الهضمي والكبد، وبغداد التعليمي، وحماية الأطفال. وجميعها في مجال الطوارئ تعتمد على طوارئ مستشفى بغداد التعليمي الذي يحتوي على قسم للطوارئ يضم أكبر قاعتين لطوارئ الباطنية والجراحية (عدا حماية الأطفال) فضلا عن الاحالات من المستشفيات الأخرى وإسعاف جرحى الانفجارات الذين يحتاجون إلى استنفار الجهود وتوفير العلاج اللازم لاسيما تعويضهم بما يحتاجونه من الدم.\nالجدول التالي يظهر أهم المستشفيات الموجودة في بغداد:\n\nمشاكل\nالوضع الأمني\n\nشهدت بغداد أسوةً بمعظم مدن العراق، تدهورًا أمنيًا كبيرًا كان أحد نتائج الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003، والذي لا تزال تعاني منه حتى اليوم. حيث عمِت المدينة مؤخرًا الفوضى والفتن الطائفية وجرائم القتل المختلفة من تفجيرات إنتحارية وسيارت مفخخة على يد منظمات متشددة.\nالتلوث والعشوائيات\n\nتعاني مدينة بغداد في الوقت الحاضر من النمو السكاني والعمراني المتزايد لا سيما بعد سقوط الحكم البعثي وما شهدته من هجرة كبيرة سواء أكان من المناطق الريفية ومن المحافظات الأخرى ومن خارج العراق.\nتُعد المركبات أبرز مسبّبات التلوث في بغداد، مع توقف تنفيذ شبكات الطرق السريعة في المدينة. كما تُعد المناطق الصناعية المنتشرة في المدينة وما تبعثه المصانع والمعامل المختلفة إلى الجو من ملوثات من أهم المسببات كذلك. ويوجد في بغداد عدد كبير من الصناعات الملوثة للهواء داخل المدينة، بعضًا منها من الصناعات الكبرى التي يفترض أبعادها إلى خارج حدود التصاميم الأساسية مثل محطة توليد الكهرباء في الدورة ومحطة توليد كهرباء جنوب بغداد. هناك أيضًا سبب آخر لتلوث الهواء في بغداد، وهو العواصف الترابية التي تهب في أغلب أيام الصيف بسبب عدم وجود مناطق الأحزمة الخضراء حول المدينة وافتقارها إلى مناطق خضراء محيطة بالمناطق السكنية، وكذلك انتشار المولدات الكهربائية الصغيرة بأعداد كبيرة.\nأما فيما يخص التلوث المائي، فقد عانى نهر دجلة الذي يخترق المدينة في السنوات الأخيرة من التلوث بشكل كبير. وقد أعلنت وزارة البيئة العراقية عن ارتفاع نسبة التلوث في النهر بصورة كبيرة عند دخول مياهه إلى مدينة بغداد، حيث إن عشرات آلاف اللترات بالثانية من مياه الصرف غير الصحي ترمى في النهر.\nالأزمات المرورية\n\nتشهد بغداد اختناقات مرورية كبيرة بسبب غلق الكثير من الطرق الفرعية والرئيسية بكتل كونكريتية مختلفة الأحجام والأغراض بعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003. ويُعزى وجود هذه الكتل إلى الوضع الأمني الراهن بالبلد ولحماية الأسواق وأماكن التجمعات من التفجيرات والأعمال المسلحة. كما تعود أسباب الأزمات المرورية أيضاً إلى قدم تصاميم شوارع المدينة، بالإضافة إلى العدد الكبير من المركبات المُسجلة مؤخراً، فهناك أكثر من مليون ونصف المليون سيارة في المدينة وحدها. كما تؤدي المواكب الدينية إلى إغلاق تام لبعض شوارع المدينة لإفساح المجال لمرور مئات آلاف الزوار إلى المراقد والمساجد الكبرى في المدينة.\nالخدمات\nشهد وضع الخدمات في بغداد تدهورًا كبيرًا بعد الحروب التي خاضها العراق في العقود الأخيرة، وخصوصًا حرب الخليج الثانية عام 1991، والغزو الأمريكي للعراق عام 2003، وما تبعه من أحداث أدت إلى وصول حال الخدمات العامة إلى مستويات متدنية جداً. حيث احتلت بغداد المرتبة الأخيرة عالميًا عام 2012، كأسوأ مدينة للعيش في العالم بحسب مسح قامت به مجموعة «ميرسل» العالمية لاستشارات الموارد البشرية، التي يقع مقرها في نيويورك. حيث استند التقرير إلى الأوضاع التي تعيشها بغداد، من حيث سوء الخدمات العامة، والاضطرابات السياسية، والاختناقات بالحواجر الكونكريتية وتراكم القمامة والمباني المهدمة، إضافة إلى الانقطاع في التيار الكهربائي، ومشاكل شبكة الصرف الصحي البدائية، حيث تعاني المدينة من فياضانات كبيرة أثناء فصل الشتاء. ويأتي هذا التصنيف أيضًا إلى جانب تقرير آخر أطلقته منظمة اليونسكو عام 2012، تم بموجبه تصنيف بغداد بالمرتبة الثالثة كأوسخ مدن العالم، وثامن عاصمة على مستوى التلوث البيئي.\n\nمدن شقيقة\nالمدن الشقيقة لبغداد هي:\n\n أذربيجان - باكو \n الأردن - عمّان \n سوريا - دمشق\n لبنان - بيروت

      "content": "Bagdad (en arabe : بَغْدَاد, baġdād, /baɣˈdaːd/ ) est la capitale de l’Irak et de la province de Bagdad. Située au centre-est du pays, elle est traversée par le fleuve Tigre. Ses habitants sont appelés « Bagdadiens » (au féminin : « Bagdadiennes »).\nAvec une aire urbaine comprenant une population estimée à 10 millions d’habitants en 2012, c’est la plus grande ville d’Irak, ainsi que la deuxième ville la plus peuplée du monde arabe et du Moyen-Orient (derrière Le Caire, la capitale de l'Égypte). C'est un carrefour de communications aériennes, routières et ferroviaires d'une grande importance stratégique pour la république d'Irak.\nLes origines de la ville actuelle remontent au moins au VIIIe siècle, avec, probablement, la présence de plusieurs petits foyers d'habitat antérieurs datant de la période préislamique. Elle fut la capitale du califat abbasside à partir du VIIIe siècle et un centre de culture et de connaissance très important pendant des siècles, jusqu’au milieu du XIIIe siècle. De 2003 (voir l'article « Bataille de Bagdad ») à 2011 (voir la section « 2011 » de l'article « Liste d'attentats de la guerre d'Irak »), Bagdad a été le centre d’un violent conflit en raison de la guerre d’Irak, déclenchée à la suite de l'invasion du pays par les États-Unis. Elle est devenue une ville d'enclaves fortifiées régies par les soldats des Forces armées irakiennes, les officiers de la police fédérale, les agents de police locaux et les agents de sécurité privés.\n\nÉtymologie\nL’origine du nom « Bagdad » et sa signification sont disputées : les auteurs arabes classiques, suivis par les écrivains modernes, penchent pour une origine persane, l'explication la plus souvent avancée étant que le mot signifie « donné par Dieu » en persan antique ; la haute estime des Abbassides pour la culture persane pourrait expliquer l’adoption d’un nom d'origine perse pour la capitale d’un califat arabe. Cependant, l’étymon assyro-araméen « forteresse de l’aigle » a également été proposé.[réf. nécessaire]\nCe nom est à l’origine du mot baldaquin, qui désigne d’abord la soie de Bagdad (Baldac ou Baudac au Moyen Âge), puis une tenture de lit.\nLa ville fut officiellement nommée Madīnat as-Salām (la cité de la paix) par son fondateur, le calife Al-Mansour. Elle était également connue sous les noms de Madīnat al-Anwār (« cité des Lumières »),ʿĀsimat ad-Dunyā (« capitale ou centre du monde »), la ville ronde et la ville d’Al Mansour.\n\nGéographie\nSite\nBagdad se trouve sur les rives du Tigre, qui est sa première source d'eau, à l'endroit où celui-ci se rapproche le plus de l'Euphrate, distant d'une trentaine de kilomètres à l'ouest de la ville.\nLe terrain sur lequel la ville fut construite est d'origine alluviale. Plat et de faible altitude, il est sujet à de nombreuses inondations périodiques.\n\nProblème de l'eau\nConsidérée sous l'aspect géopolitique et hydrologique, la région historique de Mésopotamie regroupe deux pays, l'Irak et la Syrie. La caractéristique du bassin mésopotamien réside en l'origine éloignée de ses eaux fluviales, qui prennent leur source dans les montagnes turques et iraniennes. La situation géographique de l'Irak le rend vulnérable puisqu'il est encerclé par des pays (Turquie, Syrie, Iran) capables de lui couper son approvisionnement en eau. C'est ainsi que la question de l'eau est, dans la politique extérieure de Bagdad, au cœur de tensions incessantes. Après la guerre sur l'Irak, le problème de l'eau s'est aggravé. Dans certains quartiers, l’eau courante n’est pas disponible plus de deux heures par jour. Le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) mène, depuis de nombreuses années, d'importants projets pour améliorer l'accès à l'eau potable, y compris une distribution quotidienne, par camion-citerne, à des milliers de déplacés internes près de Madinat al-Sadr (Sadr City), à Bagdad. Après des années de négligence, le réseau d’eau a également souffert de dommages plus récents dus aux vibrations causées par les bombes et le passage des tanks. Des estimations récentes de l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) montrent que près de 94 % de l’eau de Bagdad est perdue pour cause de fuites. La distribution d’eau, les sanitaires, l’électricité et les services de santé dans le centre et le sud de l’Irak ont été particulièrement frappés par les pillages et les mises à sac lors des semaines chaotiques qui ont suivi la chute de l’ancien gouvernement.\n\nClimat\nLe climat désertique de Bagdad en fait l'une des plus chaudes régions du monde pendant l'été, surtout quand le vent du golfe Persique souffle (on atteint environ 45 °C en juillet). En hiver, la pluviosité est de 136 mm et le thermomètre oscille en moyenne entre 6 et 18 °C en décembre, et entre 4 et 16 °C en janvier. Il y a une douzaine de jours de gel par an, avec des températures parfois assez basses (minimum de −6 °C).\n\nHistoire\nCalifat abbasside\nMadīnat as-Salām fut fondée ex nihilo au VIIIe siècle, en 762, par le calife abbasside Abou-Djaafar Al-Mansur et construite en quatre ans par 100 000 ouvriers. Selon les historiens arabes, il existait à son emplacement plusieurs villages pré-islamiques, dont l'un s'appelait Bagdad. Ce nom est cité dans le Talmud, de deux siècles antérieur. Cependant, selon l'historien Thierry Murcia, l'édition du Talmud de Babylone serait plus tardive que ce que l'on envisage actuellement. Elle remonterait seulement à la deuxième moitié du VIIIe siècle voire au début du IXe siècle de notre ère. Murcia estime d'ailleurs que « ce travail éditorial aurait même pu avoir été achevé dans la ville même de Bagdad », ce qui pourrait expliquer les mentions répétées de cette métropole dans le corpus de textes rabbiniques. Après la prise du pouvoir par les Abbassides au détriment des Omeyyades de Damas en 750, l'emplacement est choisi pour y fonder la capitale du califat. Même si, à partir du Xe siècle, elle a pour rivales dans cette fonction, d'abord Le Caire (avec la dynastie des Fatimides), puis Cordoue avec le nouveau califat des Omeyyades, elle joue le rôle d'une des capitales de l'islam et le restera jusqu'au milieu du XIIIe siècle.\nLa Bagdad des Abbassides était une ville ronde dont les dimensions ont fait l'objet de la part des auteurs arabes de nombreuses estimations différentes. Son diamètre était probablement de 2 534 m. Elle possédait quatre portes : la porte de Syrie au nord-ouest, la porte de Bassora au sud-ouest, la porte de Koufa au sud-est et la porte du Khorasan au nord-est. Elle était protégée par un fossé de vingt mètres de large et une double enceinte circulaire qui, en plus des quatre portes, comportait 112 tours. Le palais, la mosquée et les casernes se trouvaient au centre, tandis qu'un ou deux anneaux d'habitations étaient situés entre les deux remparts. La ville ronde était dominée par le dôme vert du palais, de 48,36 mètres de haut. Ce dôme qui fit la gloire de Bagdad se serait effondré en 941 à cause de la foudre. Des faubourgs furent aussi édifiés extra-muros, dont le quartier du Karkh, au sud de la ville ronde, où étaient notamment situés les marchés. La ville ronde fut assez rapidement abandonnée par le calife et ses administrations, et des palais furent construits dans les faubourgs. Dès 773, Al-Mansur édifia au nord-est un nouveau palais, Al-Khuld, dont le nom rappelait le paradis.\nComme la ville devenait une énorme agglomération, dont la population remuante inspirait la méfiance du calife, en 774, Al-Mansur transféra les marchés vers un nouveau quartier au sud de la Ville Ronde, qui fut appelé Al-Karkh, entre les canaux Sarat et Isa. Sous son règne également, on construisit sur la rive orientale du Tigre un camp militaire pour son fils, auquel il emprunta son nom, ʿAskar Al-Mahdi ou « camp d'Al-Mahdi », dans le quartier que l'on appela plus tard Al-Rusafa (en).\nSous Harun al-Rashid, cinquième calife de la dynastie abbasside, les membres de la famille des Barmakides occupaient le poste de vizir. Jafar fit bâtir sur la rive orientale du Tigre au sud-est de Bagdad un palais qui devait jouer un rôle important dans le développement ultérieur de la ville.\nEn 813, le califat était déchiré par une guerre civile entre les deux fils d'Harun al-Rashid, Al-Amin et Al-Ma'mūn. Elle se termina par le siège de Bagdad (en) par les forces d'Al-Ma'mūn. Il dura quatorze mois. Face à la défense acharnée de la population, les assiégeants détruisirent une grande partie de la ville ronde, qui ne s'en releva jamais.\n\nÀ partir de Al-Muʿtasim (833-842), les califes abbassides achetèrent des esclaves turcs, appelés ghulams, pour se constituer une armée dont il attendaient plus de loyauté que de leurs partisans khorassaniens. Entre ces troupes turbulentes et la population de Bagdad les heurts étaient fréquents. Ce calife décida donc de déplacer sa capitale vers Samarra. En 865, le calife d'Al-Musta`in, qui se trouvait de plus en plus sous la tutelle des Turcs, quitta Samarra et retourna à Bagdad. Les Turcs ne l'entendirent pas de cette oreille et choisirent al-Mutazz comme nouveau calife. Bagdad fut à nouveau assiégée. Le gouverneur de la ville, Mohammed ibn Abadalla ibn Tahir, fit fortifier la ville et enrôla tous les habitants dans sa défense. Affamée et excédée par la durée du siège, la population manifesta son mécontentement et des émeutes éclatèrent. Le gouverneur Tahir, tout en protestant de sa fidélité à Al-Musta`in, entama des négociations avec les Turcs. En 866, 'Al-Musta`in fut destitué puis exécuté.\nLe départ du calife n'avait pas entamé la vitalité commerciale et l'éclat intellectuel de Bagdad, où, le calife Al-Mutamid revint définitivement en 892. Il s'installa dans l'ancien palais de Jafar le Barmakide. Après sa construction, il avait été cédé à Al-Manum, qui le donna à son tour à un de ses principaux serviteurs, Al-Hasan ibn Sahl (en). Il prit alors le nom de palais Hasani. Il fut ensuite occupé par sa fille Buran, veuve d'Al-Mamun, jusqu'au retour à Bagdad d'al-Mutamid. À ce palais vinrent s'en ajouter d'autres : al-Firdus (« paradis »), al-Taj (« couronne ») ainsi qu'al-Thuraya (« Pléiades »), relié au palais al-Hasani par un couloir souterrain. Cet ensemble devint au fil du temps le Dar al-Khalifa (« demeure du Califat »).\nC'est à Bagdad qu'est fondée en 832 la plus ancienne maison de la sagesse (Bayt al-hikma), sous le règne d'Al-Mamun. C'est un établissement particulièrement actif, spécialisé dans la traduction d'ouvrages en grec, pehlevi et syriaque. Des savants y viennent de tout l'Empire abbasside, facilitant l'introduction de la science perse, grecque et indienne dans le monde arabo-musulman de cette époque. Astronomes, mathématiciens, penseurs, lettrés, traducteurs, la fréquentent, et parmi eux, al-Khwarizmi, Al Jahiz, al Kindi, Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ibn Matar et Thābit ibn Qurra.\nBagdad devient la plaque tournante du grand commerce :\n\nports du golfe Persique (Ubullah, port de Bassora ou Sirâf) vers l'Inde (épices, pierres précieuses), la Chine (soie), le Yémen (parfums) et l'Afrique orientale (bois précieux, ivoire, or) ;\nroute de la soie par l'Asie centrale ;\nroutes terrestres vers les Bulgares de la Volga, le monde scandinave (peaux et fourrures), Constantinople, l'Occident chrétien, le Soudan…\nBagdad importe des esclaves (slaves, turcs, africains) et des matières premières (bois de construction, fer) et exporte des matières premières (alun) et des produits de l'artisanat (tissus, objets de verre et de métal, entre autres).\nCertains historiens de la démographie considèrent Bagdad comme la première ville au monde à avoir atteint une population d’un million d'habitants entre les VIIIe et IXe siècles (la capitale chinoise Chang'an (Xi'an), terminus de la route de la soie, était aussi une très grande ville à cette époque). Affaiblie par des troubles politiques, sa place de « ville la plus peuplée au monde » lui est probablement ravie par Cordoue au Xe siècle. On estime la population de l'ancienne « capitale » des Francs, Aix-la-Chapelle, à environ 10 000 habitants à la même époque.\nAu xe siècle, sous l'effet des incendies et des inondations récurrents, sans parler du déménagement des califes, la ville unifiée se transforme en une série de quartiers semi-autonomes séparés par des terrains vagues, des ruines et des jardins. Ce phénomène s'accompagne d'un clivage religieux, certains quartiers étant chiites, d'autres sunnites. Vers le milieu du siècle, sous le règne de califes faibles et reclus dans leurs palais, Bagdad fut livré à l'anarchie et aux affrontements confessionnels entre chiites et sunnites. En 945, un prince bouyide chiite originaire du Daylam, s'empara de la ville et mit le calife Al-Mustakfi sous tutelle. Il devint amîr al-umarâ' (« émir des émirs ») et prit le titre honorifique de Mu`izz ad-Dawla (« réconfort de la dynastie »). Il se fit construire un palais dans le quartier dépeuplé de Shamasiya sur la rive orientale du Tigre. Il fit également construire sur les sites de l'ancien palais Khuld, un hôpital, le Bimaristan Adudi, qui devint le plus célèbre du monde musulman de l'époque. Un de ses successeurs, Adhud ad-Dawla, entreprend à partir de 979 la reconstruction de la ville. Il fait restaurer les mosquées, le réseau d'eau et les ponts. Il bâtit un complexe encore plus somptueux, dont les jardins s'étendaient jusqu'au Tigre. Les conflits confessionnels se poursuivirent. Au cours d'une émeute particulièrement violente, en 1051, la mosquée chiite de Kadhimiya, abritant les restes du septième et du neuvième imam chiite, fut incendiée par les sunnites. En 1055, le Turc seldjoukide Toghrul-Beg, sollicité par le calife, chassa sans beaucoup de mal, la dynastie bouyide, minée par les dissensions internes. Après avoir pris le titre de sultan, les Seldjoukides portèrent relativement peu d'intérêt à leur nouvelle possession. Ils désignèrent un gouverneur de Bagdad, où ils résidèrent rarement. Ils prirent le contre-pied des Bouyides et appuyèrent les sunnites. L'affaiblissement progressif des Seldjoukides incita les califes de la fin du XIIe siècle à réaffirmer leur autorité. En 1157, le sultan Muhammad, irrité par les velléités d'indépendance du calife Al-Muqtafi vint assiéger Bagdad. Au bout de près de trois mois, face à la défense énergique de la ville, il leva le siège. L'événement marqua la fin de la domination seldjoukide à Bagdad.\nÀ la fin du XIe siècle, Bagdad était formée de deux grandes parties :\n\nsur la rive est du Tigre, les habitants de Rusafa, s'installèrent plus au sud, où se forma un nouveau quartier, Muktadiya, à proximité des palais califaux. L'ensemble fut doté d'une enceinte par Al-Mustazhir en 1095. En 1221, le calife An-Nasir rénova les fortifications auxquelles il flanqua des bastions. Une seule porte est encore conservée : Bab al-Wastani dont la tour mesure 14,5 mètres de haut pour une circonférence de 56 mètres ;\nsur la rive ouest, il ne restait pratiquement plus de trace de la ville ronde, à l'exception de la grande mosquée. Khark, par contre, continuait à prospérer.\n\nLe déclin de Bagdad s'accentua lorsqu'elle fut ravagée par les Mongols de Houlagou Khan en 1258, après un siège de 20 jours, du 20 janvier jusqu'au 10 février, épisode de la bataille de Bagdad. La ville tout entière fut désarmée et sa population massacrée. Le Bayt al-Hikma, ou maison de la sagesse, fut pillé et son contenu jeté dans le Tigre : traités philosophiques, livres d'art, de poésie et d'histoire, ouvrages scientifiques et mathématiques — la richesse intellectuelle de plusieurs siècles. On dit que quand le pillage mongol prit fin, le Tigre était noir d'encre. Le calife Al-Musta'sim fut tué par les envahisseurs. Cet événement constitua une rupture dans l'histoire de Bagdad, qui cessa définitivement d'être le siège du califat.\n\nDes Mongols aux Ottomans\nLa ville n'était plus que l'ombre d'elle-même mais survécut. Jusqu'en 1339, elle fit partie du domaine de la dynastie mongole des Ilkhanides. Le célèbre voyageur Ibn Battûta a laissé une description de la ville à cette époque. Ensuite Hassan Bozorg, le fondateur de la dynastie des Jalayirides, s'y installa.\nLa ville fut prise deux fois par Tamerlan, la première fois en 1393 sans subir trop de dommages. En 1401, en revanche, il fit massacrer tous les habitants, n'épargnant que les hommes de religion. De 1410 à 1507, Bagdad tomba entre les mains des Turcomans du Mouton noir et des Turcomans du Mouton blanc. Jamais la ville n'était tombée aussi bas. L'historien égyptien Al-Makrizi écrivit en 1437 qu'elle ne méritait pas le nom de ville. En 1444, un voyageur vénitien, Nicolo de Conti, la confondit, comme d'autres européens, avec Babylone.\nEn 1507, Bagdad fut occupée par les Safavides persans. Elle tomba ensuite entre les mains des Ottomans : Soliman le Magnifique s'en empara en 1534. Bagdad se révolta contre eux en 1623 puis, au cours de la Troisième guerre turco–séfévide (1623-1639), soutint un long siège, et ne fut prise qu'en 1638 par Mourad IV. Ce siège, qui dura 39 jours et mobilisa des dizaines de milliers d'hommes eut un retentissement jusqu'en France, puisqu'il apparaît dans le premier numéro de la Gazette de Théophraste Renaudot : il est l'acte final du conflit entre Ottomans et Perses.\nAprès 1638, en effet, les guerres entre les Ottomans et les Safavides connurent une longue trêve. Entre 1638 et 1704, Bagdad fut gouvernée par 34 pachas, presque tous incompétents ou cruels[réf. nécessaire]. Réduite à l'état de bourgade insignifiante aux confins de l'Empire ottoman, perpétuellement menacée par les tribus bédouines des environs, elle ne comptait plus qu'une quinzaine de milliers d'habitants. En 1704, un homme énergique, Hassan Pacha, fut nommé gouverneur de Bagdad. Il entreprit d'acheter de jeunes esclaves pour en faire une armée de Mamelouks. Il eut tôt fait de mettre au pas les tribus bédouines et d'étendre son pouvoir de Mossoul au nord à Bassora au sud. Son fils, Ahmed, lui succéda en 1723, au grand dépit du gouvernement de Constantinople qui n'exerçait plus qu'une autorité nominale sur Bagdad. En 1733, Ahmed dut faire face à une menace grave : le nouveau maître de la Perse, Nâdir Châh, vint mettre le siège devant Bagdad, comptant sur la famine pour forcer la ville à se rendre. Elle ne dut son salut qu'à l'arrivée d'une armée de secours ottomane. Une nouvelle tentative perse en 1744 se solda également par un échec. Après la mort d'Ahmed, le pouvoir des mamelouks, qui occupaient tous les postes importants, dura jusqu'en 1831. Au mois de mars de cette année Bagdad fut touchée par une épidémie de peste, suivie en avril d'une crue du Tigre particulièrement dévastatrice, qui emporta une partie des murailles et 7 000 maisons. Entre la moitié et les deux-tiers de la population disparurent. Le sultan Mahmoud II profita de l'occasion pour restaurer l'autorité de la Sublime Porte. Les mamelouks furent exterminés et un gouverneur nommé directement par Constantinople.\n\nAu sein de l'Empire ottoman, qui cherchait à se réformer, Bagdad commença elle-même à se moderniser. La population s'accrut peu à peu. En 1853, elle était évaluée à 60 000 personnes, en 1877 à 70 ou 80 000 et à la fin du XIXe siècle à 100 000. Les puissances européennes commençaient à s'y intéresser : un résident britannique nommé par la Compagnie britannique des Indes orientales s'y était installé dès 1798. En 1862, les Britanniques créèrent une compagnie de bateaux à vapeur qui assurait la liaison entre Bagdad et Bassora sur le Tigre. Sous le gouvernement éclairé de Midhat Pacha, une ligne de tramway relia Bagdad à Kadhimiya. Ce pacha créa également la première maison d'édition et le premier journal de Bagdad, ainsi que des écoles. Il mit également sur pied un conseil municipal élu. Une décision malheureuse pour le patrimoine de Bagdad fut la démolition des murailles séculaires de la ville en 1868, pour en faire des boulevards qui ne virent jamais le jour.\nAu cours de la Première Guerre mondiale les Ottomans s'engagèrent dans le conflit aux côtés des Allemands. Après qu'un corps expéditionnaire britannique eut subi une terrible défaite à Kut en 1916, le gouverneur de Bagdad décida de tracer à travers le lacis de ruelles de la rive orientale une large artère (à peu près) droite, afin de faciliter le mouvement des troupes. Cette artère, que l'on appela plus tard la rue Rachid, transforma radicalement le paysage de la ville.\n\nDu mandat britannique à la chute de la monarchie\nLe 11 mars 1917, un corps expéditionnaire britannique entre à Bagdad, capitale de la Mésopotamie (l'Irak actuel), et en chasse les Turcs ottomans. Lors de la conférence de San Remo (1920), la Grande-Bretagne reçoit un mandat de la part de la Société des Nations pour administrer trois vilayets ottomans (Bagdad, Bassora et Mossoul).\n\nEn 1921, Bagdad est déclarée capitale du nouveau royaume d'Irak.\n\nEn avril 1941, Rachid Ali al-Gillani, un homme politique antibritannique, comptant sur l'appui allemand, fit un coup d'État. Les Britanniques ripostèrent en envoyant un corps expéditionnaire qui atteignit Bagdad le 31 mai. Dans la nuit du 1er juin, un violent pogrom éclata dans la capitale. Au cours de ces événements, connus sous le nom de Farhoud, quelque 200 Juifs furent tués, de façon souvent horrible.\nEn 1948 l’Irak entre en guerre contre l’Etat Juif ( Israël ). A la suite de la victoire Israélienne les juifs d’Irak à partir de 1950 sont expulsés et spoliés ( notamment un bâtiment qui héberge aujourd’hui encore l’ambassade de France  ) les juifs de Bagdad qui représentaient 40% de la population.\nDans les années 1950, de nombreux projets architecturaux ou urbanistiques virent le jour grâce à la manne pétrolière. Certains aboutirent, comme le Musée national d'Irak conçu dans les années 1930 par l'architecte allemand Werner March, qui fut réalisé une vingtaine d'années plus tard. D'autres ne furent jamais exécutés, comme le projet de Le Corbusier pour une cité olympique, dont seul le gymnase fut finalement construit sous Saddam Hussein, ou encore les plans de Frank Lloyd Wright pour un nouveau Bagdad.\n\nLe 14 juillet 1958, la monarchie fut renversée lors d'un coup d'État dirigé par le général Kasem. Le roi Fayçal II fut tué ainsi que toute la famille royale. Les corps mutilés du prince héritier Abd al-Ilah et du Premier ministre Nouri Saïd furent exhibés dans les rues de Bagdad.\n\nDe l'avènement de la république à la chute de Saddam Hussein\nEn 1968, un coup d'État permet au Parti Baas de s'emparer du pouvoir. En 1979, Saddam Hussein devint président. Au cours de la guerre Iran-Irak (1980-1988), Bagdad se trouvait loin de la zone de combats, mais, à partir de 1985, au cours de la « guerre des villes », elle fut touchée par des missiles sol-sol iraniens, qui sapèrent le moral de la population.\n\nAprès la guerre d'Irak le problème de l'eau s'est aggravé. Dans certains quartiers l’eau courante n’est pas disponible plus de deux heures par jour. Le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) mène, depuis de nombreuses années, d'importants projets pour améliorer l'accès à l'eau potable.\n\nDurant l'opération liberté irakienne, après 21 jours de bombardements, les forces américaines, après avoir rencontré une faible résistance aux portes de Bagdad, prennent le contrôle de la ville à partir du 9 avril 2003. Cela est symbolisé par une statue géante de Saddam Hussein renversée par un char américain en direct devant les médias. Le jour même, des pillages commencent, notamment au musée national d'Irak, dans les hôpitaux et les bâtiments administratifs.\n\nL'après Saddam\nÀ partir de 2003, avec l'attentat du 19 août contre le siège de l'ONU et la mort de l'envoyé spécial de cette organisation Sergio Vieira de Mello, la ville est touchée par des attentats et la violence, ce qui a conduit à ce que certains comparent à une épuration ethnique, les membres des diverses communautés chiites et sunnites se regroupant dans des quartiers à part.\n\nÉducation\nLa Mustansiriya Madrasah fut fondé en 1227 par le calife Al-Mustansir. L'édifice fut rebaptisé université al-Mustansiriyah en 1963. Il s'agit de la plus grande université d'Irak et de la seconde plus importante du monde arabe.\nLe collège de Bagdad, fondé en 1932, est un lycée d’élite pour les garçons âgés de 11 à 18 ans.\nAvant que survienne la guerre du Golfe, la ville accueillait plusieurs écoles internationales dont :\n\nÉcole française de Bagdad ;\nDeutsche Schule Bagdad ;\nBaghdad Japanese School (バグダッド日本人学校).\n\nUniversités\nOutre l'université Al-Mustansiriya, la ville accueille aussi d'autres universités :\n\nuniversité irakienne ;\nuniversité d'Al-Nahrain ;\nuniversité de Bagdad ;\nuniversité de technologie (Irak).\n\nCulture\nBagdad a toujours rayonné par sa culture à travers le monde arabe et au-delà, ayant accueilli, inspirée et joué le rôle de mécène pour nombre d'artistes. Beaucoup d'artistes du monde arabe ont fréquenté la ville, tels Nizar Kabbani, Oum Kalthoum ou Fairuz.\nLe dialecte arabe de Bagdad diffère des autres centres urbains d'Irak ; il contient plus de caractéristiques propres aux dialectes nomades, cela est probablement dû aux multiples exodes et repopulations que connut la ville durant le Moyen Âge.\nLa ville abrite un théâtre, le théâtre national irakien (en), qui connut des dommages avec la guerre au cours de la première décennie du XXIe siècle, et dans lequel se produit l'Orchestre national (en) depuis 1944.\nLe théâtre national connut un élan dans les années 1990 lorsque survinrent des sanctions de l'ONU sur l'importation de films étrangers.\nIl abrite une École de Musique et de Ballet et Institut des Beaux-Arts.\nDes musées sont également présents, abritant de nombreux trésors de l'Antiquité et de civilisations disparues.\n\nRayonnement intellectuel\nBagdad occupa, au cours des premiers siècles suivant sa fondation, une place prépondérante dans la production littéraire, artistique et intellectuelle arabo-musulmane, sous le patronage des hauts dignitaires de la cour abbasside. L’école Mustansiriya, construite par le calife abbasside Al-Mustansir bi-llah, est considérée comme l’une des plus vieilles universités arabo-islamiques où on enseignait les sciences du Coran de la tradition de Mahomet, les doctrines islamiques, les sciences de la langue arabe, les mathématiques, les préceptes de l’islam et les différentes disciplines de la médecine. La ville devient rapidement le premier centre culturel du monde, accueillant près d'un million de personnes. Au milieu du IXe siècle est créée la maison de la sagesse où l’on procède à la traduction de grands philosophes grecs et des personnes viennent d’Europe ou d’autres parts du monde pour se spécialiser en médecine, en physique, en astronomie, en météorologie, en mathématiques et dans tous les domaines.\n\nMonuments et lieux\nPalais abbasside (XIIe siècle) ;\nmosquée Abou Hanîfa ;\nuniversité al-Mustansiriyah (XIIIe siècle) ;\nle Khan Mirjan est un édifice de briques construit en 1359 par le gouverneur de Bagdad, Amin ud-Din Mirjan. Il fut conçu pour servir de caravansérail, dont les revenus iraient à la fondation (Waqf) créée pour l'entretien de la Madrasa Mirjaniyya, comme le rappelle l'inscription au-dessus de la porte d'entrée. Le bâtiment de 31,5 m sur 45 possède deux étages disposés autour d'un espace central, dont les voûtes s'élèvent à 14,5 m. Dans les années 1990, le gouvernement irakien procéda à des transformations pour en faire un restaurant ;\nmadrassa Mirjaniyya (1357) ;\n\nmausolée de Zumurrud Kathun, situé à Karkh, date de 1202. Il a été construit pour abriter la dépouille de la veuve du calife abbasside Al-Mustadhi. On le confond parfois avec la tombe de Zubayda, l'épouse du calife Hâroun ar-Rachîd. Un dôme conique décorné de muqarnas (stalactites), surmonte une base octogonale ;\nmosquée al-Rahman (« le Miséricordieux »).

Ouvert en 1971 sous Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr, il s'agit du plus grand zoo du Moyen-Orient, s'étendant sur une superficie de 81 ha. Il héberge aujourd'hui environ 1 070 animaux.\n\nAdministration\nLa ville comporte dix districts administratifs. Chaque district est divisé en quartiers. Il en existe 89 en tout. Le Tigre partage la ville en deux parties :\n\nRusafa, regroupe les six districts de la rive est :\nRusafa (en)\nAdhamiyah\nThawra (« Révolution »), plus connu sous le nom de Sadr City\nTisaa Nissan (« 9 avril », date de la chute de Saddam Hussein en 2003), plus connu sous son ancien nom, Baghdad Al-Jidida, c'est-à-dire Nouveau-Bagdad (en)\nKarrada (en) (où se trouve le campus Jadriya de l'université de Bagdad)\nZafraniya (en)\nKarkh, rassemble les quatre districts de la rive ouest :\nKarkh (en) (avec la zone verte)\nKadhimiya (en)\nMansour (en) (d'après le nom du deuxième calife abbasside)\nal-Rashid (en)\n\nDémographie\nDu VIIIe au XIIIe siècle Bagdad était la plus grande métropole de son époque. Autour de l’an 900, la population de Bagdad était estimée à environ 1 million d’habitants. En 1900 la population était estimée à 145 000 habitants, 580 000 en 1950. En 1948 40% de la population était juive. En 2001, la population de l'agglomération de Bagdad est estimée à 4 958 000 habitants.\n\nÉconomie\nBagdad est le centre industriel du pays et son carrefour de communications aériennes, routières et ferroviaires. Douze ponts permettent le franchissement du fleuve Tigre. On y trouve raffineries de pétrole, cultures agricoles, tanneries et autres industries textiles. La ville produit des vêtements, des ustensiles ménagers, des bijoux, des articles de cuir et de feutre et des tapis commercialisés dans les souks (marchés arabes). Ces souks aux allées étroites constitués de petites boutiques et d'étals font partie de l'histoire de la ville et en sont caractéristiques.\n\nTransports\nTransports aériens\nBagdad est desservie par un aéroport international situé à environ 20 km au sud-ouest du centre-ville.\n\nTransports ferroviaires\nLa capitale irakienne est desservie dès 1903 par le train depuis la ville turque de Konya par la ligne baptisée « Chemin de fer Berlin-Bagdad ». La ligne est mise en sommeil depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Actuellement, le train arrive à Bagdad par le nord (Samarra) et par le sud (Kut) à la gare centrale de Bagdad, sur la rive ouest, magnifique bâtiment de style Art déco érigé entre 1947 et 1951 par la firme britannique Wilson & Mason Partners.\n\nTransports urbains\nReligion\nJusqu'en 2003 et l'invasion menée par les États-Unis, les chiites, les sunnites et les chrétiens se mêlaient dans de nombreux quartiers de la ville. Après une explosion de violences interconfessionnelles, les quartiers se sont divisés suivant la religion ; les chiites ont accru leur domination. Quant aux chrétiens, leur nombre a reculé de moitié en Irak.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nViolence\nAprès la chute du régime de Saddam Hussein et l'entrée de l'armée américaine dans la ville, Bagdad connait une montée de violence et la multiplication du nombre des attentats-suicides et les attentats à la voiture piégée.\nEn 2009, une ONG mexicaine la classe comme la 10e ville la plus dangereuse du monde derrière Baltimore aux États-Unis.\nFin 2010, la violence avait reculé de 90 % par rapport au record de 240 incidents par jour, en 2007. Des explosions ont encore lieu.

      "summary": "Bagdad (en arabe : بَغْدَاد, baġdād, /baɣˈdaːd/ ) est la capitale de l’Irak et de la province de Bagdad. Située au centre-est du pays, elle est traversée par le fleuve Tigre. Ses habitants sont appelés « Bagdadiens » (au féminin : « Bagdadiennes »).\nAvec une aire urbaine comprenant une population estimée à 10 millions d’habitants en 2012, c’est la plus grande ville d’Irak, ainsi que la deuxième ville la plus peuplée du monde arabe et du Moyen-Orient (derrière Le Caire, la capitale de l'Égypte). C'est un carrefour de communications aériennes, routières et ferroviaires d'une grande importance stratégique pour la république d'Irak.\nLes origines de la ville actuelle remontent au moins au VIIIe siècle, avec, probablement, la présence de plusieurs petits foyers d'habitat antérieurs datant de la période préislamique. Elle fut la capitale du califat abbasside à partir du VIIIe siècle et un centre de culture et de connaissance très important pendant des siècles, jusqu’au milieu du XIIIe siècle. De 2003 (voir l'article « Bataille de Bagdad ») à 2011 (voir la section « 2011 » de l'article « Liste d'attentats de la guerre d'Irak »), Bagdad a été le centre d’un violent conflit en raison de la guerre d’Irak, déclenchée à la suite de l'invasion du pays par les États-Unis. Elle est devenue une ville d'enclaves fortifiées régies par les soldats des Forces armées irakiennes, les officiers de la police fédérale, les agents de police locaux et les agents de sécurité privés.",

      "content": "## Overview\nBaghdad (Arabic: بـغداد Baġdād) is the capital and largest city of Iraq, with an estimated population of 6-7 million. Once one of the greatest centres of learning and culture in the world, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. It was once a favoured destination on the 'hippie trail' and is packed full of sights.\n\n## History\nFounded in 762 CE by caliph al-Mansur as the Round City, Baghdad became the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate and grew into one of the largest scientific centres in the Islamic world during the Golden Age of Islam. Five centuries of peace came to an end in 1258 when the city was destroyed by the Mongols who advanced westwards. After a period of Ottoman rule, Baghdad became the capital of Iraq under a British protectorate and as an independent state. Since then, Baghdad has been subject to war, terrorist attacks and attempts at reconstruction.\n\n## By plane\nThe national airline is Iraqi Airways[dead link] that operates a growing fleet of more than 30 modern jets. They mainly provide domestic flights but Iraqi Airways also offers flights to numerous international destinations, including a few routes from Europe. Numerous other operators in the Middle East also fly to Baghdad, with daily flights from most regional hubs. There are also a few low cost airlines such as FlyBaghdad that have flights to Baghdad. The best way to travel from Europe is either with Austrian or Turkish Airlines. They operate several direct flights per week from Vienna and daily from Istanbul respectively. For those working for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Iraq, there are charter airlines operating into Baghdad.\nThe frequent sandstorms that hit the area can obscure visibility and cause flights to be turned away. It is not unusual for commercial flights to make it all the way to BIAP, and then turn around and return to their origin due to limited visibility on the runway.\n33.26706644.2310971 Baghdad International Airport (مطار بغداد الدولي) (16 km west from the centre of Baghdad). All of the usual airport facilities are available, such as banks, money exchange, ATMs, mobile phone companies, restaurants and even a hotel. The airport has three interlinked terminals. It is easy to walk between the terminals both land side and air side. One terminal is used by Iraqi Airways (the most counter-clockwise one) and the middle one handles all other flights. The food outlets are small and limited air side, so if you have a long wait, it is better to check in and return back through security to use the land side restaurants. When departing, be prepared for some queuing. Entrance to the airport grounds about three or four miles from the airport terminal will require you and your vehicle to wait in line to be searched. Security checkpoints can take from two to three hours to process through. BGW  IATA      (updated Jul 2020)\n\n## By train\nBaghdad is the heart of Iraqs' limited railway system. International trains, such as the famous Taurus Express from Istanbul, have been suspended since 2003 and are not likely to return for the foreseeable future. However, there are several domestic services which are useful for tourists. An overnight service connects Baghdad with the southern port city of Basra every night. Both sleeper and couchette classes are available, with price ranging from 10,000 dinars for a couchette to 25,000 dinars for premium sleepers. The train also carries a restaurant car.\nThere are twice-daily trains from Ramadi via Fallujah and a weekly service from Samarra. Additionally, there are seasonal services from Karbala, mostly during religious festivals.\n33.323744.38052 Baghdad Central railway station (محطة بغداد المركزية) (Qahira Street, a kilometre north of city centre, at Damascus Square.). Completed in 1953, Baghdad Central railway station is an architecturally impressive terminus, all trains call here.      (updated May 2024)\n\n## By car\nOverland travel is possible from all neighbouring countries and while major roads are generally in an acceptable condition, travelling by car is strongly discouraged due to violence. Baghdad is in the centre of Iraq's highway network, with Freeway 1 from Basra and continuing towards the Jordanian borde being the major thoroughfare. Confusingly, the road from Mosul is named Highway 1.\n\n## By bus\nMultiple daily buses arrive from most major Iraqi cities. Long-distance bus services from Istanbul and Ankara restarted in the summer of 2018, with two departures per week. However journey time is a gruelling 30 hours or more. Most long-distance buses arrive at the sprawling 33.3245844.3844773 Al-Alawi bus terminal (گراج العلاوي), next to the central station. Buses leave and arrive from stands both north and south of the Allawi skyway.\n\n## Get around\nWhile the almost daily bombings and shootings have subsided, there is always a risk of getting caught in violence when travelling around the city. Staying vigilant is essential. Many high-end hotels provide their own transport, some even with armoured cars.\nBaghdad is served by an extensive but chaotic bus network; maps and route information for the network are not available in English. Taxis are also plentiful and quite cheap to use. Walking is possible in parts of the city, especially in and around the old city. Cycling is not uncommon among locals, but there is next to no infrastructure to support it.\n\n## See\nA combination of heavy redevelopment during the second half of the 20th century, two decades of warfare and neglect has not been kind to Baghdad's architectural and cultural heritage. Generally, the eastern side contains the older districts while the western side is newer. The historic old quarter contains a myriad of alleys and small streets with buildings dating back to the Ottoman era or even older. Many of them are unfortunately in various stages of disrepair. The old quarter is also home to the heart and soul of Iraqi literacy  and intellectual community, Mutanabbi Street. The street is lined with bookstores and outdoor book stalls as well as cafés to discuss matters of the day.\n33.33845444.3897671 Mustansiriya Madrasah (المدرسة المستنصرية).

Many were built during the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and evoke mixed feelings among locals, while others are universally loved. A large number of high-profile public sculptures were made by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat (1929-2011), nicknamed the sheik of sculptors.\n33.30855644.38916711 Monument to the Unknown Soldier (صرح الجندي المجهول).

Many contractors hire personnel with prior military experience to return to Iraq. Persons with military experience or who are fluent in Arabic are especially sought after. Lastly, there are civilian government agencies in Iraq. USAID  send their own personnel as well as contractors to Iraq.\nThe agencies above are all relevant for US citizens. Citizens of other countries with a presence in Iraq can apply for work through the respective agencies in their home country.\n\n## Buy\nRugs and DVDs are available to buy.

One traditional art is coppersmithing with the Baghdad copper souk producing some of the finest copper artifacts in the world. However it and several other traditional crafts are in decline due to cheaper imported goods.\n33.33999944.391762 Coppersmith souk (Souk al-Safafeer, سوق الصفافير).

While some bars exists, particularly along Abu Nawas Street, a safe bet is always the bars of the top tier hotels. Many international organisations have their own bars as well, and some are open to outsiders.\nTea houses and cafés are however ubiquitous, and often open late into the night.\n33.340144.38821 Shahbandar Café, Mutanabbi St. The oldest operating tea house in Baghdad, established in 1907.

Sleeping in hotels in the proper city is always a risk due to bombings.\n\n## Stay safe\nTravel to Baghdad is not recommended because of security concerns. Westerners are particular targets of kidnapping and assassination by militant and extremist groups. Baghdad airport is secure, so transiting there if necessary is safe. See the warning on the Iraq article.\nThe easiest way to stay safe in Baghdad is not to go there in the first place, except for official reasons. Most expats and business travellers to Iraq hire a security detail, which constantly monitors the security situation within Iraq and around Baghdad. Travel outside the International Zone is extremely dangerous. Roadside and car bombs are detonated every day in Baghdad. Many Iraqis are armed. Markets and popular gathering places are frequent targets of bombers. As a foreigner you are more likely to be targeted for kidnapping. Kidnappings are often financially motivated. These threats are not restricted to Americans or women.\n\n## Heatwaves\nBaghdad is prone to heatwaves, with temperatures exceeding 50 °C (122 °F) during July and August. Making the situation worse, frequent electrical outages means that even where there is air conditioning it might not work. Being prepared and staying hydrated is essential.\n\n## Embassies\nAustralia, Haifa Street, next to Ibn Sina Hospital, International Zone, Baghdad, Iraq, ☏ +964 780 923 7565, info.baghdad@dfat.gov.au.\nCanada, British Embassy Compound, International Zone, ☏ +964 782 783 5084, BGHDD.Consular@international.gc.ca.\nChina, P.O.Box 2386，Al-jadryaa Post Office, ☏ +964 790 191 2315, chinaemb_iq@mfa.gov.cn.\nGreece, Hay Babil, AL-Jadriyah Sector 913, Rd. 31/ Built 63, ☏ +964 1 778 2273, +964 790 364 2046 (Emergencies), fax: +870-763262272, gremb.bag@mfa.gr.\nRomania, Mahalla 601, Zuqaq 15, no.
