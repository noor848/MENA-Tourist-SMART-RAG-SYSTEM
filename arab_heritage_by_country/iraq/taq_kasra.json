      "content": "Tāq Kasrā (Arabic: طاق كسرى, romanized: ṭāq kisrā), also transcribed as Taq-i Kisra or Taq-e Kesra (Persian: طاق کسری, romanized: tâğe kasrâ) or Ayvān-e Kesrā (Persian: ایوان خسرو, romanized: Eivâne Xosrow, meaning Iwan of Khosrow) are the remains of a Sasanian-era Persian monument, dated to c. the 3rd to 6th centuries, which is sometimes called the Arch of Ctesiphon. It is located near the modern town of Salman Pak, Iraq. It was the facade of the main palace in Ctesiphon, and is the only visible remaining structure of the ancient capital city. The archway is considered a landmark in the history of architecture, and is the second largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world after the Gavmishan Bridge in Iran.\n\nHistory\nThe exact time of the structure's construction is not known with certainty. Some historians believe it was constructed under Shapur I who ruled Sassanian Persia from 242 to 272 AD and some other believe that construction possibly began during the reign of Anushiruwan the Just (Khosrow I) after a campaign against the Byzantines in 540 AD. The arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, was about 37 meters high, 26 meters across and 50 meters long, the largest man-made, free standing vault constructed until modern times.\nThe arch was part of the imperial palace complex. The throne room—presumably under or behind the arch—was more than 30 m (110 ft) high and covered an area 24 m (80 ft) wide by 48 m (160 ft) long. The top of the arch is about 1 meter thick while the walls at the base are up to 7 meters thick. The catenary arch was built without centring. In order to make this possible a number of techniques were used. The bricks were laid about 18 degrees from the vertical which allowed them to be partially supported by the rear wall during construction. The quick drying cement used as mortar allowed the fresh bricks to be quickly supported by those that were previously laid.\nThe Taq Kasra is now all that remains above ground of a city that was, for nine centuries—from the 2nd century BC to the 7th century AD—the main capital of the successor dynasties of the Persian empire: Parthians and Sassanids. The structure left today was the main portico of the audience hall of the Sassanids who maintained the same site chosen by the Parthians and for the same reason, namely proximity to the Roman Empire, whose expansionist aims could be better contained at the point of contact.\nThe structure was captured by the Arabs during the conquest of Persia in 637. They then used it as a mosque for a while until the area was gradually abandoned. In the early 10th century, the Abbasid caliph al-Muktafi dug up the ruins of the palace to reuse its bricks in the construction of the Taj Palace in Baghdad.\nThe Arabic poet Al-Buhturi wrote a famous poem about the ruins in the 9th century.\nThe monument is also the subject of a poem by the Persian poet Khaqani, who visited the ruins in the 12th century.\n\nModern era\nIn 1851, French artist Eugène Flandin visited and studied the structure with Pascal Coste who remarked \"the Romans had nothing similar or of the type.\"\nIn 1888, a serious flood demolished the greater part of the edifice.\nIn 1940, the British writer Roald Dahl, then undergoing pilot training at RAF Habbaniya near Baghdad took an award-winning photograph using a Zeiss camera of the Arch of Ctesiphon in Iraq which was subsequently auctioned by the Dahl family to raise funds for the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre. The photo made £6,000. In his autobiography Boy he writes:\n\nYou may not believe it, but when I was eighteen I used to win prizes and medals from the Royal Photographic Society in London, and from other places like the Photographic Society of Holland. I even got a lovely big bronze medal from the Egyptian Photographic Society in Cairo, and I still have the photograph that won it. It is a picture of one of the so-called Seven Wonders of the World, the Arch of Ctesiphon in Iraq. This is the largest unsupported arch on earth and I took the photograph while I was training out there for the RAF in 1940. I was flying over the desert solo in an old Hawker Hart biplane and I had my camera round my neck. When I spotted the huge arch standing alone in a sea of sand, I dropped one wing and hung in my straps and let go of the stick while I took aim and clicked the shutter. It came out fine.\nThe monument was in the process of being rebuilt by Saddam Hussein's government in the course of the 1980s, when the fallen northern wing was partially rebuilt. All works, however, stopped after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. From 2004 to 2008 the Iraqi government cooperated with the University of Chicago's Diyala Project to restore the site at a cost of $100,000. The Ministry of Culture also invited a Czech company, Avers, to restore the site. This restoration was completed in 2017.\nOn March 7, 2019, a partial collapse further damaged the Taq Kasra, just two years after its latest restoration was completed.\nIn January 2021, Iranian Minister of Cultural Heritage Ali Asghar Mounesan mentioned that a credit of about $600,000 would be required for the restoration of Taq Kasra.\n\nDocumentary film\nIn 2017, Pejman Akbarzadeh, based in the Netherlands, made the first full-length documentary film about Taq Kasra: Taq Kasra: Wonder of Architecture. The monument had been in danger of ISIS attacks in 2015–2016; Akbarzadeh feared that it might be destroyed soon, and therefore felt urgency to film his documentary. The film explores the history and architecture of Taq Kasra with many scholars and archaeologists in various countries.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nPersian Empire\nSasanians\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortress\nHatra\nPersian architecture\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nTaq Kasra Online Information Center\nArchent: Taq-i Kisra\nGlobal Heritage Fund page on Ctesiphon\nSwiss journalist's photos of Taq-e Kasra in 1970s: \"Taq-e Kasra; a Persian archaeological sight outside Persia (Photo)",

      "content": "Le taq-e Kisra ou Taq Kasra (littéralement : iwan de Chosroès ; en persan : طاق كسرى) est un monument perse sassanide en ruines situé aujourd'hui en Irak, à 35 kilomètres au sud-est de Bagdad. C'est le seul vestige visible de l'antique cité de Ctésiphon (appelée par les Arabes Al-Madaïn).\n\nHistoire\nLa date de construction de ce palais est incertaine. Il existe deux hypothèses qui retracent la fondation du complexe, reposant sur des sources historiques de nature différentes. Oscar Reuther, spécialiste de l’architecture du Proche-Orient situe la construction du palais dans la première moitié du VIe siècle de notre ère, sous le règne du roi sassanide Khusraw I Anushirvan. Pour avancer son hypothèse, Oscar Reuther met en avant le style de l’arcade aveugle de la façade. C’est donc une analyse architecturale qui lui permet d’énoncer sa supposition. Au contraire, Ernst Herzfeld, iranologue et archéologue allemand, s’appuie sur la chronique sassanide Khudhay-Nama pour situer la date de fondation au IIIe siècle de notre ère, sous le règne Shapur I. Enfin la confusion concernant la date de construction est alimentée par des écrivains de la fin du Moyen Age, tels que Tabari qui confondent le palais avec « le palais blanc ».\nTaq-e Kisra est considéré comme le symbole de l'Empire perse durant la dynastie sassanide. Il est un symbole de la puissance de l’empire sassanide. L'arc, le plus grand jamais construit à cette époque, mesure 37 mètres de hauteur, 27 mètres de largeur et 50 mètres de longueur. La forme de l'arc s'approche d'une loi mathématique : la « chaînette renversée », appelée ainsi par Huygens en 1691. Il est probable que l’iwan s’ouvrait sur une cour massive et qu’un autre iwan, aussi monumental lui faisait face.\nConcernant la décoration, des tessons de mosaïques de verres ont été retrouvés à proximité.\nCette construction marque l’imaginaire des musulmans et va devenir la matrice d’une architecture avec des porches ouverts sur jardins que l’on retrouve dans de nombreuses mosquées ou encore sous la forme d’iwan donnant sur des cours.\nPendant l'expansion islamique du VIIe siècle, le palais est en partie détruit. Selon les historiens, l'autodafé des immenses bibliothèques perses par les troupes musulmanes, contenant tout le savoir de l'empire sassanide dura plus de six semaines, d'un feu continu, nuit et jour. En 1888, une crue du Tigre provoque l'effondrement d'un tiers de l'édifice et en 1909, une partie de la façade nord s'effondre. En 1972, la Direction Générale des Antiquités d’Irak entame la restauration de l’aile sud. Les travaux de restauration pour l’aile nord débutent en 1975. Sa reconstruction, entreprise par Saddam Hussein, a été interrompue en 1991. Le monument n'est pas classé à l'Organisation des Nations unies pour l'éducation, la science et la culture (UNESCO).\n\nEn 2018, Pejman Akbarzadeh a réalisé le premier documentaire sur Taq Kasra. Le film a été présenté dans divers musées et conférences en Europe et aux Etats-Unis.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\nMarcel Dieulafoy, L'Art antique de la Perse.

      "content": "## Overview\nBaghdad (Arabic: بـغداد Baġdād) is the capital and largest city of Iraq, with an estimated population of 6-7 million. Once one of the greatest centres of learning and culture in the world, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. It was once a favoured destination on the 'hippie trail' and is packed full of sights.\n\n## History\nFounded in 762 CE by caliph al-Mansur as the Round City, Baghdad became the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate and grew into one of the largest scientific centres in the Islamic world during the Golden Age of Islam. Five centuries of peace came to an end in 1258 when the city was destroyed by the Mongols who advanced westwards. After a period of Ottoman rule, Baghdad became the capital of Iraq under a British protectorate and as an independent state. Since then, Baghdad has been subject to war, terrorist attacks and attempts at reconstruction.\n\n## By plane\nThe national airline is Iraqi Airways[dead link] that operates a growing fleet of more than 30 modern jets. They mainly provide domestic flights but Iraqi Airways also offers flights to numerous international destinations, including a few routes from Europe. Numerous other operators in the Middle East also fly to Baghdad, with daily flights from most regional hubs. There are also a few low cost airlines such as FlyBaghdad that have flights to Baghdad. The best way to travel from Europe is either with Austrian or Turkish Airlines. They operate several direct flights per week from Vienna and daily from Istanbul respectively. For those working for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Iraq, there are charter airlines operating into Baghdad.\nThe frequent sandstorms that hit the area can obscure visibility and cause flights to be turned away. It is not unusual for commercial flights to make it all the way to BIAP, and then turn around and return to their origin due to limited visibility on the runway.\n33.26706644.2310971 Baghdad International Airport (مطار بغداد الدولي) (16 km west from the centre of Baghdad). All of the usual airport facilities are available, such as banks, money exchange, ATMs, mobile phone companies, restaurants and even a hotel. The airport has three interlinked terminals. It is easy to walk between the terminals both land side and air side. One terminal is used by Iraqi Airways (the most counter-clockwise one) and the middle one handles all other flights. The food outlets are small and limited air side, so if you have a long wait, it is better to check in and return back through security to use the land side restaurants. When departing, be prepared for some queuing. Entrance to the airport grounds about three or four miles from the airport terminal will require you and your vehicle to wait in line to be searched. Security checkpoints can take from two to three hours to process through. BGW  IATA      (updated Jul 2020)\n\n## By train\nBaghdad is the heart of Iraqs' limited railway system. International trains, such as the famous Taurus Express from Istanbul, have been suspended since 2003 and are not likely to return for the foreseeable future. However, there are several domestic services which are useful for tourists. An overnight service connects Baghdad with the southern port city of Basra every night. Both sleeper and couchette classes are available, with price ranging from 10,000 dinars for a couchette to 25,000 dinars for premium sleepers. The train also carries a restaurant car.\nThere are twice-daily trains from Ramadi via Fallujah and a weekly service from Samarra. Additionally, there are seasonal services from Karbala, mostly during religious festivals.\n33.323744.38052 Baghdad Central railway station (محطة بغداد المركزية) (Qahira Street, a kilometre north of city centre, at Damascus Square.). Completed in 1953, Baghdad Central railway station is an architecturally impressive terminus, all trains call here.      (updated May 2024)\n\n## By car\nOverland travel is possible from all neighbouring countries and while major roads are generally in an acceptable condition, travelling by car is strongly discouraged due to violence. Baghdad is in the centre of Iraq's highway network, with Freeway 1 from Basra and continuing towards the Jordanian borde being the major thoroughfare. Confusingly, the road from Mosul is named Highway 1.\n\n## By bus\nMultiple daily buses arrive from most major Iraqi cities. Long-distance bus services from Istanbul and Ankara restarted in the summer of 2018, with two departures per week. However journey time is a gruelling 30 hours or more. Most long-distance buses arrive at the sprawling 33.3245844.3844773 Al-Alawi bus terminal (گراج العلاوي), next to the central station. Buses leave and arrive from stands both north and south of the Allawi skyway.\n\n## Get around\nWhile the almost daily bombings and shootings have subsided, there is always a risk of getting caught in violence when travelling around the city. Staying vigilant is essential. Many high-end hotels provide their own transport, some even with armoured cars.\nBaghdad is served by an extensive but chaotic bus network; maps and route information for the network are not available in English. Taxis are also plentiful and quite cheap to use. Walking is possible in parts of the city, especially in and around the old city. Cycling is not uncommon among locals, but there is next to no infrastructure to support it.\n\n## See\nA combination of heavy redevelopment during the second half of the 20th century, two decades of warfare and neglect has not been kind to Baghdad's architectural and cultural heritage. Generally, the eastern side contains the older districts while the western side is newer. The historic old quarter contains a myriad of alleys and small streets with buildings dating back to the Ottoman era or even older. Many of them are unfortunately in various stages of disrepair. The old quarter is also home to the heart and soul of Iraqi literacy  and intellectual community, Mutanabbi Street. The street is lined with bookstores and outdoor book stalls as well as cafés to discuss matters of the day.\n33.33845444.3897671 Mustansiriya Madrasah (المدرسة المستنصرية). Often referred to as the Abbasid Palace, this medieval-era scholarly complex was established in 1227 CE.

Many were built during the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and evoke mixed feelings among locals, while others are universally loved. A large number of high-profile public sculptures were made by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat (1929-2011), nicknamed the sheik of sculptors.\n33.30855644.38916711 Monument to the Unknown Soldier (صرح الجندي المجهول).

Free Wi-Fi.    (updated Feb 2017)\n\n## Drink\nWhile Baghdad is undergoing something of a liberalization regarding both night life and alcohol, it is still not widely available and large parts of society frowns upon it. While some bars exists, particularly along Abu Nawas Street, a safe bet is always the bars of the top tier hotels. Many international organisations have their own bars as well, and some are open to outsiders.\nTea houses and cafés are however ubiquitous, and often open late into the night.\n33.340144.38821 Shahbandar Café, Mutanabbi St. The oldest operating tea house in Baghdad, established in 1907.

Sleeping in hotels in the proper city is always a risk due to bombings.\n\n## Stay safe\nTravel to Baghdad is not recommended because of security concerns. Westerners are particular targets of kidnapping and assassination by militant and extremist groups. Baghdad airport is secure, so transiting there if necessary is safe. See the warning on the Iraq article.\nThe easiest way to stay safe in Baghdad is not to go there in the first place, except for official reasons. Most expats and business travellers to Iraq hire a security detail, which constantly monitors the security situation within Iraq and around Baghdad. Travel outside the International Zone is extremely dangerous. Roadside and car bombs are detonated every day in Baghdad. Many Iraqis are armed. Markets and popular gathering places are frequent targets of bombers. As a foreigner you are more likely to be targeted for kidnapping. Kidnappings are often financially motivated. These threats are not restricted to Americans or women.\n\n## Heatwaves\nBaghdad is prone to heatwaves, with temperatures exceeding 50 °C (122 °F) during July and August. Making the situation worse, frequent electrical outages means that even where there is air conditioning it might not work. Being prepared and staying hydrated is essential.\n\n## Embassies\nAustralia, Haifa Street, next to Ibn Sina Hospital, International Zone, Baghdad, Iraq, ☏ +964 780 923 7565, info.baghdad@dfat.gov.au.\nCanada, British Embassy Compound, International Zone, ☏ +964 782 783 5084, BGHDD.Consular@international.gc.ca.\nChina, P.O.Box 2386，Al-jadryaa Post Office, ☏ +964 790 191 2315, chinaemb_iq@mfa.gov.cn.\nGreece, Hay Babil, AL-Jadriyah Sector 913, Rd. 31/ Built 63, ☏ +964 1 778 2273, +964 790 364 2046 (Emergencies), fax: +870-763262272, gremb.bag@mfa.gr.\nRomania, Mahalla 601, Zuqaq 15, no.
